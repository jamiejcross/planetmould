    "excerpt": "T-2 toxin is a secondary metabolite produced by different Fusarium species that causes serious problems in the poultry industry. It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000\u202fnM\u202fT-2 toxin for 48 and 72\u202fh. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72\u202fh. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48\u202fh. The concentration of 8-OHdG was reduced by 72\u202fh exposure to 100\u202fnM\u202fT-2 toxin. In the case of IL-6, the 1,000\u202fnM\u202fT-2 toxin was able to decrease its levels after 48 and 72\u202fh, whereas IL-8 levels were lowered after 72\u202fh by all three toxin treatments. Overall, these resu",

    "excerpt": "IntroductionMucormycosis is a catastrophic fungal infection in immunocompromised patients and has a high mortality rate. Amphotericin B colloidal dispersions have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of mucormycosis; however, there is limited literature on the management of severe skin damage secondary to the extravasation of amphotericin B colloidal dispersions.Case presentationA 36-year-old diabetic woman with severe pulmonary mucormycosis developed skin damage on her left foot after 34\u202fdays of amphotericin B colloidal dispersion treatment via a peripheral vein. The medication was switched to a central vein, and nursing interventions, including silver alginate ion dressing and saline wet compress, successfully managed the injury. By day 155, the skin had completely healed with minimal residual pigmentation.ConclusionThis case report describes the management of a severe skin injury caused by amphotericin B colloidal dispersion extravasation in an immunocompromised patient, carried out by bedside nurses.Relevance for clinical practiceThis study presents an effective management strategy for skin damage caused by amphotericin B colloidal dispersions extravasation, emphasiz",
