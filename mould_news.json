    "excerpt": "Fusarium species are important opportunistic fungal pathogens. Diabetic foot infection (DFI) involves diverse causative pathogens however, the potential for fungal etiologies is often overlooked. We describe a case of DFI following foot trauma. Despite prior broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, the wound failed to heal and presented persistent swelling and pain. Microbiological re-evaluation and molecular identification confirmed the causative agent as Fusarium keratoplasticum (F. keratoplasticum), a pathogenic species within Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC). The isolate exhibited high MICs against most antifungals, thus systemic antifungal therapy was withheld. Successful management was achieved through systematic surgical debridement combined with silver-ion dressings, resulting in pathogen eradication and complete wound healing. Currently, F. keratoplasticum infections remain extremely limited, particularly those definitively confirmed to species level. This case broadens the pathogen spectrum of DFI and highlights the need for comprehensive etiologic evaluation in therapy-refractory wounds, offering a non-pharmacological strategy for resistant fungal infections.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease",
    "excerpt": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), primarily caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus, is a life-threatening fungal infection with high mortality rates. This study investigated novel resistance mechanisms to caspofungin (CAS) in clinical Aspergillus isolates with particular focus on genetic alterations in the CoQ5 gene and their functional implications. One hundred and forty-eight Aspergillus isolates from IPA cases were undergone antifungal susceptibility testing, genotyping and phylogenetic analyses, mutations and gene expression studies of Fks1 and CoQ5 genes, and three-dimensional structural analysis of wild-type and mutant CoQ5 proteins. The etiologic agents of IPA comprised A. flavus (72.3%) and A. fumigatus (27.7%). Caspofungin (CAS) resistance was reported in 7.4% of A. flavus and 9.7% of A. fumigatus isolates. Genetic analysis identified a novel mutation in the CoQ5 gene (T371C) resulting in an amino acid substitution (Y102H) in a CAS-resistant A. flavus isolate. Structural modeling suggests this variant may impair protein stability and mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to resistance through indirect mechanisms. The definitive establishment of causality and direct contribution of CoQ5 mutations to caspofungin susceptibility requires further functional validation by employing targeted genetic manipulation and phenotypic validation to directly interrogate the role of the Y102H variant in the resistance mechanism.",

    "excerpt": "The widespread use of polypropylene-based surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated environmental plastic pollution, necessitating sustainable degradation strategies. This study investigates the biodegradation potential of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii on nonwoven polypropylene mask layers under both nutrient-rich (MSM broth) and soil microcosm conditions. A multidisciplinary approach combining weight loss measurements, FTIR-ATR spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize physical, chemical, and biochemical changes in the polymer matrix. Results show that A. bridgerii induced significant degradation in both environments, with the highest weight loss % observed in MSM microcosms (20.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u202f%), indicating active fragmentation and partial mineralization. In soil microcosms, fungal inoculation led to the most advanced oxidation (SAUB CI up to \u223c4.6), extensive surface fragmentation, and the release of unique volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including DEHP (\u223c15\u202f% GC-MS area) and long-chain ketones. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by the lowest residual mask mass (9.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u202f%), suggesting enhanced mineralization in the nutrient-limited soil. SEM analysis further confirmed pronounced fiber degradation and biofilm formation. These findings underscore the role of fungal metabolism and environmental context in modulating polypropylene decay, supporting a multiple mechanistic process such as oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation. The integration of FTIR, SEM, and GC-MS provided robust evidence of mask polymer degradation and highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii as a bioremediation agent for PPE waste.",

    "excerpt": "Sludge dewatering is vital for reducing volume and energy consumption, yet traditional chemical conditioners are limited by cost and environmental concerns. Herein, a green fungal flocculant was developed by cultivating Aspergillus niger using food waste hydrolysate as the sole substrate, achieving a biomass yield of 140.3\u202fmg/g-chemical oxygen demand. Alkaline modification effectively altered surface chemistry by degrading hydrophilic amide groups, enhancing hydrophobicity, surface charge repulsion, and hyphal dispersion. When applied as a coagulant aid with 3% FeCl3, the base-modified fungal flocculant markedly improved sludge dewatering, increasing Dx(90) from 102.0 to 1542.9\u202f\u03bcm and reducing specific resistance to filtration by 75.7%, with a final cake water content of 56.8%. Mechanistic analyses revealed that improved fungal network porosity, enhanced hydrophobic interactions, and coordination between fungal functional groups and Fe3+ ions synergistically facilitated water release. This bio-based strategy offers a sustainable alternative that simultaneously valorizes food waste and replaces synthetic polymeric flocculants in sludge treatment.",

In this study, Aspergillus niger was engineered to enable the bioconversion of lignin-derived aromatics and base-catalyzed depolymerized (BCD) lignin streams into malic acid, a value-added C4 dicarboxylic acid with broad industrial relevance. Overexpression of the C4 dicarboxylate transporter C4T318 from Aspergillus oryzae enhanced malic acid secretion, while medium optimization under buffered conditions further improved the production. The engineered strain efficiently assimilated representative lignin-derived aromatics, including 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid, producing up to 3.9 g/L malic acid. Conversion of BCD lignin liquors from poplar and sorghum demonstrated effective utilization of heterogeneous aromatic mixtures, generating up to 0.82 g/L malic acid. This work demonstrates direct fungal conversion of real lignin streams into malic acid and establishes A. niger as a promising platform for sustainable lignin valorization.",

The application of plant endophytic microorganisms has proven to be a reliable and safe strategy for controlling fungal diseases. In the present study, an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9, was isolated from healthy bean seeds and exhibited strong inhibitory activity against Botrytis cinerea. This strain could form biofilms, enhance the activity of defense enzymes, and boost the content of active secondary metabolites in green beans. The crude lipopeptide extracts from NEAU-HLD-9 remarkably suppressed the mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea. It is worth noting that the crude lipopeptide extracts also effectively controlled gray mold in green beans by reducing both disease incidence and lesion diameter. PCR and LC-MS analyses suggested that the crude lipopeptide extracts comprised two antifungal compounds. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the strain contained 15 gene clusters responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis, including those for antifungal compounds. In summary, both Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9 and its crude lipopeptide extracts strongly inhibited Botrytis cinerea in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a promising approach for the management of gray mold in green beans.",

Results demonstrated that A. pullulans S2 significantly reduced both the incidence and severity of disease while enhancing the activity of enzymes related to defense and the accumulation of antioxidant compounds. Additionally, 2-Phenylethanol generated by A. pullulans S2 exhibited strong antifungal properties by disrupting the cell membrane integrity and promoting reactive oxygen species accumulation in pathogens. Furthermore, a lyophilized formulation of A. pullulans S2 was developed using an optimized protective agent combination via response surface methodology. This resulted in a high post-lyophilization survival rate of 85.2\u00a0% and significant biocontrol efficacy after 90 days of storage.

This study proposes a strategy based on self-supervised learning (SSL) for the accurate detection of Aflatoxin B1 in peanuts and maize. Firstly, an SSL backbone network was constructed to perform a spectral reconstruction task on masked spectra, providing pre-trained weights for subsequent supervised learning. Secondly, the spectral reconstruction error was innovatively used as a wavelength attention mechanism, integrated with the fine-tuned encoder from the SSL stage to develop a classification model. This model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9805\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0019 in peanuts and 0.9478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0060 in maize, outperforming other deep learning models. Furthermore, key wavelengths were selected based on the spectral reconstruction error. Experimental results demonstrated that the 40 selected key wavelengths outperformed other methods, with a more uniform distribution, capturing richer spectral features. The strategy in this study provides an efficient solution for few-sample spectral detection.",

Affinity magnetic beads (AMBs), which integrate highly specific recognition elements with magnetic carriers, represent a promising solution owing to their strong enrichment capability, good dispersibility, soften matrix effects, and high compatibility with automated systems. This review discusses the structure, working principles, and applications of AMBs employing antibodies, aptamers, and molecularly imprinted polymers as recognition elements. It also evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of both chromatographic and rapid detection methods. Finally, the review highlights current challenges and future perspectives for the application of AMBs in mycotoxin detection.",

    "excerpt": "Regulated cell death (RCD) is a highly conserved and coordinated cellular demise process. In animals, the fate of cells depends on the precise regulation of RCD, with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) playing a major role as negative regulators of cellular death. In fungi, RCD regulates crucial processes, including growth, development, stress response, host-pathogen interactions and more. However, the biochemical details of this process are not well understood in this kingdom. IAPs are, remarkably, one of the few RCD/Apoptosis-regulatory proteins that are conserved in fungi. Here, we performed large-scale bioinformatic analyses of IAPs in sequenced fungal genomes. While most fungal organisms have a single IAP gene (81.65\u00a0% of the genomes analyzed here), some fungi lack IAPs altogether and others have multiple IAP-like genes. Using the Aspergillus nidulans IAP, AnBir1, we show that this protein is required for survival and regulates cell death by inhibiting caspase-like activity. Moreover, disrupting RCD by constitutively expressing AnBir1 impacted fundamental processes, including development, stress response and secondary metabolism. We also show that fungal RCD can be hijacked for therapeutic purposes. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we targeted the AnBir1 homolog of the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SsBir1) during plant infection. Targeting SsBir1 resulted in enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum infection. We propose that IAPs play a critical role in regulating caspase activities and other RCD-related processes in fungi and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for fungal infections.",

    "excerpt": "Mitochondria play a central role in fungal metabolism, adaptation, and pathogenesis, yet the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial genomes in plant-pathogenic Alternaria species remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative mitochondrial genomes analysis of five economically important Alternaria species-Alternaria burnsii, A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata, and A. gossypina-to investigate structural architecture, genomic variation, selection pressures, repeat element dynamics, and phylogenetic relationships. The mitochondrial genomes exhibited a conserved gene content of 13-14 core genes, 30-33 tRNA and 2 rRNA, but varied in size due to differences in intron insertions, intergenic spacers, and repetitive sequences. Strong A/U-biased codon usage was observed across species, consistent with high AT-richness and translational optimization. Purifying selection dominated across essential respiratory complexes (cox1-3, atp6-9 and cob), indicating functional constraint, while signals of positive selection and pseudogenization (disrupted rps3 in A. burnsii YUN-Z1107) suggest lineage-specific adaptations. We identified evolutionary hotspots in both coding and non-coding regions enriched with InDeLs and repeat expansions. A total of 920 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were annotated, with A. burnsii YUN-Z1107 showing the highest SSR density, particularly pentanucleotide motifs, implicating replication slippage in genome plasticity. Long repetitive elements were associated with intron mobility and possible recombination events, especially in A. arborescens YUN-Z0872. Phylogenomic analysis of 29 Ascomycota species confirmed a monophyletic Alternaria clade within Pleosporales, although limited resolution within the genus suggests complex evolutionary histories.

In the context of climate change, with indoor temperatures potentially exceeding 28\u00a0\u00b0C in summer, and amid the ongoing energy crisis, the French government recommends maintaining indoor temperature at 19\u00a0\u00b0C.

We therefore cultured three reference strains of Aspergillus creber under four common dwelling conditions (A: 19\u00a0\u00b0C, 50\u00a0% RH; B 19\u00a0\u00b0C, 75\u00a0% RH; C: 28\u00a0\u00b0C, 50\u00a0% RH; D: 28\u00a0\u00b0C, 75\u00a0% RH) on five different culture media (MEA, MEA+10\u00a0% NaCl, CYA, CY20S, and M40Y). Temperature significantly influenced growth (mean diameters: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 22.8\u00a0mm; 28\u00a0\u00b0C: 34.4\u00a0mm; mean biomasses: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 108.3\u00a0mg; 28\u00a0\u00b0C: 329.1\u00a0mg), STE production (mean concentrations: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 3.5\u00a0\u03bcg/g/28\u00a0\u00b0C: 34.5\u00a0\u03bcg/g), and the MICs of antifungal agents, with a notable association between increased temperature and elevated MICs. The highest STE production (up to 99\u00a0\u03bcg/g) occurred at 28\u00a0\u00b0C on M40Y agar. Positive correlations were observed between diameters and biomass (r\u00a0=\u00a00.791; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), diameters and STE production (r\u00a0=\u00a00.431; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and biomass and STE production (r\u00a0=\u00a00.305; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), suggesting a strong link between primary growth and secondary metabolism. These findings highlight the potential health risks posed by rising indoor temperatures, as projected under global climate change, which may lead to increased STE production in Aspergillus creber.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Fusarium wilt, commonly referred to as Panama disease, stands as the most catastrophic disease in banana cultivation. Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), it has imposed substantial economic burdens on banana farmers worldwide. Foc4-SIX13 was identified as a potential effector in Foc4, and is characterized by secretion into xylem. It is a protein comprised of 312 amino acids, and features a functional signal peptide without recognizable motifs or domains. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the expression of Foc4-SIX13 was markedly upregulated during the initial stage of fungal infection in banana plants. Through homologous recombination, the successful knockout of Foc4-SIX13 was accomplished. The resulting deletion mutant exhibited impaired mycelial growth and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress, coupled with a significant decrease in pathogenicity towards bananas. Foc4-SIX13\u0394sp could not induce cellular necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that Foc4-SIX13\u0394sp was localized in both cytoplasm and nuclei of N. benthamiana cells. The interaction between Foc4-SIX13 and banana Nudix hydrolase 23 (Ma-NUD23) was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Taken together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Foc4-SIX13 in the pathogenicity of Foc4 and its importance in the Fusarium infection process. Consequently, Foc4-SIX13 is proposed as a promising target for future management strategies against Fusarium wilt, and it can provide a novel avenue for the breeding of banana varieties with enhanced disease resistance.",

However, the unstable nature and insufficient activity of the FAD-dependent dimer hinder the antibacterial capacity. In this study, A GOX from Aspergillus eucalypticola (AeGOXL), outstanding for its catalytic efficiency, was selected for laboratory evolution through random mutagenesis. Three thermostable variants Q148K, H283Y, and P514K were selected and form the combined variant Q148K/H283Y (M1), superior in both thermostability (T50 increased 13\u202f\u00b0C, Tm increased 6.7\u202f\u00b0C, and 2.1-fold of t1/2 prolonged at 80\u202f\u00b0C) and catalytic activity (97% and 57% increase in specific activity and kcat/Km), comparing with the WT. Structural investigations elucidated the molecular stabilization due to additional hydrogen bond network formation, while long-range interaction elevated the flexibility of key residues, improving the substrate affinity. For antibacterial capacity, M1 significantly brought down the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli separately to 21.3 and 17.4\u202fmg/L (52.5% and 70.5% lower than the WT, comparable to sensitive conventional antibiotics), in accordance with the electron microscope manifestation. This research delved into the GOX functional based enzymatic antibacterial approaches, providing milder and more eco-friendly substrate to address antibacterial requirements.",

In this study, a natural and eco-friendly strategy was developed using Ligusticum jeholense essential oil (LEO), extracted via optimized enzymatic-deep eutectic solvent microwave-assisted method (EDP-MAHD), which achieved a 3.38-fold higher yield than conventional extraction. GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC\u2085\u2080, 0.0718 \u03bcL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

    "excerpt": "SUMMARY Iatrogenic central nervous system mold infections (ICNSMIs) are rare and occur as sporadic complications of neurosurgical procedures or device insertions. However, recent outbreaks have been reported in outpatient settings, following epidural injections with contaminated medicines. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies published without date restrictions through July 2025 on ICNSMIs. We identified 905 cases of such infections, with 4% occurring in non-outbreak settings and 96% associated with five documented outbreaks. In both non-outbreak and outbreak settings, infections were more common after spinal/epidural injections, with contaminated medicines or supplies being the primary source. Due to their angioinvasive tendencies, ICNSMI caused by Fusarium solani and Aspergillus species had a higher frequency of stroke/intracranial hemorrhage ( P = 0.011), aneurysm formation ( P = 0.012), and resulted in higher mortality compared with ICNSMI caused by other molds ( P &lt; 0.001). ICNSMI, as a result of catheter-associated fungemia, was very rare (only one case). Strategies to identify ICNSMI in exposed individuals during an outbreak have included (i) symptom-driven lumbar puncture, (ii) screening lumbar puncture regardless of symptoms, and (iii) screening brain MRI regardless of symptoms. Measurement of (1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid was a valuable tool to diagnose ICNSMI preemptively. Outcomes of ICNSMI following neurosurgical procedures were poor (90-day mortality of 35%) and depended on the route of inoculation, mold species, timing of diagnosis, and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy in combination with source control. Patients with ICNSMI often suffered long-term neurologic sequelae, even with the most optimal management strategies.",

    "title": "Contribution of terrestrial processes in reducing environmental mycotoxin levels: a review on mycotoxin-soil interactions",
    "source": "Latest Results",
    "excerpt": "Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that can harm humans and animals. They occur primarily in infected crops, with higher levels under environmental stress. Their origin in contaminated crops is the main contributor to soil contamination. Although high levels can be detected in soils, these are transitory and in average far lower than in contaminated crops, indicating a key role of functioning soils in down-regulating environmental mycotoxin levels. This review examines mycotoxin-soil interactions in terms of four terrestrial processes: (i) adsorption to soil fractions, (ii) microbial transformation and mineralisation (iii) transport/mobilization with water, (iv) plant uptake and response. Results show that the main process for dissipation in soils is microbial, improved by biomass and activity and by a narrow fungi-to-bacteria ratio. This aligns with incubation studies suggesting a key role of bacteria in the degradation of mycotoxins. This path is favoured by the availability of the mycotoxins, that can be reduced by the adsorption to soil particles: the aromatic character and the carbonyl functions are decisive for adsorption to soil organic matter and clay particles, respectively. Consequently, mycotoxin levels in environmental compartments can be interpreted as the (net) result of entry and dissipation processes mediated through the soil, rather than the soil acting as a source of them. Plant uptake represents a minor pathway of contamination compared to the in situ production. In soil-plant systems, suboptimal nitrogen (N) and pesticide management are factors triggering fungal infestation and mycotoxins levels. Fungal infestation and mycotoxin can induce the polyphenolic response of the plant, along with mycotoxin metabolization as reported for DON. Based on this newly-made interpretation, this review provides future perspectives on mycotoxin occurrence and fate under climate change and intensive agriculture and proposes soil-based strategies for an integral env",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with \u226515% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Aspergillus , Mucorales, and Fusarium ) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria \u22651 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%).

    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), a potent mycotoxin frequently detected in improperly stored poultry feed, induces hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa , exhibits strong antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory activities; however, its efficacy and mechanisms in mitigating AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity in broilers remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary CUR supplementation on growth performance and liver health of broilers exposed to AFB 1 . RESULTS A total of 720 broilers (eight replicates of 15 birds each per treatment) were fed a basal diet, an AFB\u2081\u2010contaminated diet (1 mg kg \u22121 ), or AFB 1 diets supplemented with CUR (100, 300, or 500 mg kg \u22121 ) for 42 days. AFB 1 exposure significantly reduced average daily gain and increased feed conversion ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas CUR supplementation \u2013 particularly 300\u2013500 mg kg \u22121 \u2013 improved growth performance relative to the AFB 1 group ( P &lt; 0.05). CUR also decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, alleviated hepatic histopathological damage, enhanced hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), and suppressed malondialdehyde accumulation ( P &lt; 0.01). At the molecular level, CUR upregulated Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes while downregulating NOD\u2010like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase\u20101, and interleukin\u20101\u03b2, indicating attenuation of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Dietary curcumin effectively mitigated AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity and performance loss in broilers through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings highlight CUR as a promising natural feed additive for protecting poultry against mycotoxin\u2010induced oxidative and inflammatory damage. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Introduction Relapses occur in up to 40% of patients after prolonged courses of antifungal treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). The factors predisposing to relapse remain poorly defined. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of adults treated for \u2265 6 months with oral azoles for CPA. Patients who completed antifungal therapy and were deemed not to require further treatment were included. Demographic, clinical, radiological and serological data at treatment completion were collected. CPA relapse was defined as symptomatic and radiological deterioration leading to re\u2010initiation of antifungal therapy. Cox regression and Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses were used to identify predictors of relapse and mortality. Results Among 125 patients (56% male; mean age 61 years), median treatment duration was 36 months. Thirty\u2010two (26%) developed relapse; relapse rate at 1 year was 16%. Aspergillus sensitisation (specific IgE &gt; 0.35 IU/mL) and elevated Aspergillus \u2010specific IgG (&gt; 40 mg/L) at treatment completion were independently associated with relapse ( p &lt; 0.05). No patient with IgG &lt; 40 mg/L relapsed. Underlying lung disease (COPD or prior tuberculosis), extent of radiological involvement, or treatment duration were not significantly associated with relapse or mortality. Conclusions Aspergillus sensitisation and persistently elevated Aspergillus \u2010specific IgG at the end of antifungal therapy were independent predictors of CPA relapse. These parameters may reflect ongoing fungal airway burden and can help identify patients requiring extended or closer post\u2010treatment follow\u2010up.

    "excerpt": "Gray mold caused by <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> significantly threatens strawberry production. This study evaluated the efficacy of ipflufenoquin, a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, against fungal pathogens isolated from Korean strawberry fields in 2023. Ipflufenoquin demonstrated a high <i>in vitro</i> sensitivity to <i>B. cinerea</i> and broad activity against other pathogens. Fruit and greenhouse trials confirmed its robust control of gray mold, including strains resistant to multiple fungicide classes. However, treatment shifted the fungal community, promoting less sensitive genera, such as <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Rhizopus</i>. Structural modeling with AlphaFold2 and molecular docking confirmed that ipflufenoquin binds to the quinone binding tunnel of DHODH, correlating binding affinity with susceptibility. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that ipflufenoquin suppresses primary metabolic pathways while triggering a robust stress response, up-regulating detoxification and efflux transporter genes.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The substantial increase in fungal diseases, the limited availability of antifungal drugs, and rising resistance to existing treatments highlight the urgent need for developing novel antifungal drugs. Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4\u201316 \u03bcg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades. We identified a novel polyene macrolide from Kitasatospora melanogena with potent activity against major fungal pathogens. This compound disrupts both the fungal cell wall and membrane while inducing oxidative stress, revealing a multifaceted mechanism of action.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD \u2086\u2080\u2080 changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. IMPORTANCE This study provides a perspective on developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens with implications for agriculture and food security. The effectiveness of current fungicides is increasingly limited by resistance, narrow target ranges, and environmental concerns. By combining genetic approaches with chemical screening, this work offers a more systematic way to identify candidate antifungal agents and better understand their possible mechanisms. The framework may also be adapted for use in other areas, including medical and veterinary applications, suggesting potential broader applicability.

Plant-derived ingredients serve as major protein sources in aquaculture feeds; however, the increasing use of insects as alternative nutrient sources introduces additional potential pathways for mycotoxin contamination. Strong evidence shows that exposure of fish to mycotoxins can negatively affect their health, leading to reduced growth, impaired immune response and reproductive disorders. However, knowledge of the effects of mycotoxins on farmed insects is still limited. Little is known about the insect metabolism of mycotoxins and their transfer to animal feed, which constitutes a weakness of safety assessments of insects as feed components. This review provides comprehensive information about the consequences of mycotoxin contamination of feed materials and feeds used in aquaculture. To facilitate understanding of the problem and its scale, the mycotoxin levels in plant materials and finished feeds used in aquaculture were compiled and analyzed together with the contamination levels of fish-derived food. Moreover, the available data on the effects of fish exposure to the selected mycotoxins are summarized, highlighting the complexity of the biological activity of these compounds. Finally, recent challenges to the safety of using insects as a protein source in fish nutrition are discussed.

Our previous study identified novel basidiomycete-specific chss (chsb) clades (BI&#8211;BIII) and suggested functional differences between the chsb genes of clade BII and BIII. This study, together with our previous work, presents the first comprehensive functional analysis and identification of clade-specific roles of chsb genes in vegetative hyphae of the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. Using homologous recombination, we disrupted chsb1 (clade BI) and simultaneously disrupted chsb2 and chsb3 (clade BII) to investigate their roles in vegetative growth, cell wall biosynthesis and stress response. Deletion of chsb1 led to reduced colony growth, impaired aerial hyphae formation, thinner cell walls and significant cell wall remodelling. In contrast, single disruptions of chsb2 or chsb3 caused mild phenotypes, while double disruption of these genes resulted in severe growth defects, complete loss of aerial hyphae, and abnormal septation.

Previous studies have shown that TLO null mutants are unable to form hyphae and are hypersensitive to environmental stress. However, the reason for the TLO gene expansion remains unclear, and the current study aimed to determine if reduction in the TLO family copy number affected virulence. In order to investigate this, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to generate two TLO-depleted mutants: one mutant retaining only TLO&#946;2 (CaTLO2) and the second mutant containing only TLO&#947;5 (CaTLO5). Both TLO-depleted mutants exhibited increased filamentous growth, increased susceptibility to specific stresses and reduced virulence in a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). In vitro, the CaTLO5 mutant also exhibited impaired hyphal escape from macrophages and reduced hyphal invasion of oral keratinocytes. We then investigated if complementation with TLO&#945;1, a gene previously shown to restore wild-type growth in a &#916;tlo null mutant, could restore virulence. In vitro infection models showed",

While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non- fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the \u03b2-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency.

These challenges include sampling (spot urine, 24\u00a0h urine, plasma, serum etc.) and analytical issues (missing reference standards, matrix effects, protein adducts, recovery, limit of detection, stability during storage, etc.). Further critical aspects needed for biomarker interpretation and human health risk evaluation are a lack of data for several mycotoxins such as (a) health-based guidance values (b) long-term biomarkers, (c) reliable food intake data (d) toxicokinetic parameters in humans, for example clearance and transfer rates to urine or milk and (e) HBM guidance values. In this review, these issues will be discussed based on recent HBM studies and recommendations for future studies as well as research needs will be derived.\n                Graphical abstract",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus ), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% \u00b1 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% \u00b1 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% \u00b1 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1\u20132) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% \u00b1 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3\u20135 (F1 92.1% \u00b1 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for laboratories lacking specialized mycology expertise, especially in resource-limited settings.

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus . Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus ; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus . This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy",

This study assessed its potential to protect broiler chickens against aflatoxin B\u2081 (AFB\u2081)-induced toxicity. AMSP was screened for phytochemicals and antioxidant activity. A total of 320 Cobb 500 chicks were assigned to four diets using a completely randomized design: CTRL (control), ATB1 (0.4\u00a0mg/kg AFB\u2081), A1AF (AFB\u2081 + 0.5\u00a0g/kg AMSP), and A2AF (AFB\u2081 + 1.0\u00a0g/kg AMSP) for six weeks. Exposure to AFB\u2081 by the birds in ATB1 markedly (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) impaired growth performance, as evidenced by reduced final body weight (2,315.82\u00a0g vs. 2,743.23\u00a0g in CTRL), lower protein intake (813.45\u00a0g vs. 837.24\u00a0g), and increased feed conversion ratio (1.70 vs. 1.47).

    "source": "Latest Results",
    "excerpt": "Emerging mycotoxins are defined as fungal metabolites not yet regulated or routinely monitored&#8212;are gaining attention due to their potential health impacts and widespread occurrence in food and feed. These emerging mycotoxins are known to exert diverse in vitro toxic effects. Furthermore, they share relevant antimicrobial properties, which may affect intestinal microbiota and hence gut health, immunity and animal welfare, particularly in herbivorous species. Despite growing interest in small herbivorous pets such as rabbits and rodents, limited data are available on mycotoxin contamination in their commercial diets. This study aimed to develop and validate a reliable LC&#8211;MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of selected emerging mycotoxins&#8212;such as beauvericin (BEAU), enniatins (ENN A, A1, B, B1), and alternariol (AOH)&#8212;in rabbit and rodent feed. A total of 200 feed samples (100 each for rabbit and rodent feed) were randomly collected from pet shops and markets in Bangkok, Thailand. Sample preparation was based on the QuEChERS approach, and detection was performed using liquid chromatography&#8211;tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Method validation was conducted according to SANTE/11,312/2021 guidelines, demonstrating acceptable performance in terms of selectivity, linearity, recovery, precision, and LOQ. The results revealed contamination with at least one emerging mycotoxin in 50% of rabbit feed and 39% of rodent feed samples, with BEAU being the most frequently detected compound. Co-contamination of BEAU and ENNs was found in 13.2% of rabbit feed and 8.2% of rodent feed samples, while AOH was not detected. These findings highlight the need for routine monitoring of emerging mycotoxins in pet food, especially for herbivorous small pets that may be rather vulnerable to microbiota-disrupting agents.

    "excerpt": "<i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (<i>A. flavus</i>) is a plant pathogenic fungus that produces toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxins, posing a threat to food safety and human health. As a kind of food additive, phytic acid (PA) exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity. However, the antifungal effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> are not well understood. Here, transcriptomic and biochemical analyses were carried out to investigate the inhibitory effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> and potential mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that PA effectively inhibited the vegetative growth, conidiation and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production of <i>A. flavus</i>. In addition, we found that PA also suppressed the pathogenicity of <i>A. flavus</i> on peanut and maize seeds. The transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, oxidative stress, ergosterol biosynthesis, and the MAPK signalling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i>. Biochemical experiments further demonstrated that PA could destroy cell membrane integrity and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, eventually resulting in defects of development and AFB1 biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>. Taken together, this research enhances understanding of the antifungal mechanism of PA, and provides novel insights into its potential as a food additive to prevent and control <i>A. flavus</i> contamination.",

    "excerpt": "Contamination of food products such as rice with mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins (AFs), can endanger human health and cause economic problems. Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a public health concern, especially in countries where rice is a staple food, due to its carcinogenic, acute, and chronic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentration levels of AFB1 in domestic (Iranian) rice samples. The presence and mean concentration of AFB1 in 70 Iranian rice samples collected from local markets in Tehran, Iran were measured using a competitive ELISA method. Furthermore, a health risk assessment was performed based on estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFB1 from rice consumption, margin of exposure (MOE), and liver cancer risk in Iranian children and adults. AFB1 was detected in 26 samples (37.1%) with the mean concentration levels of 1.86 \u00b1 0.67 ng/g (ranges from 1.12 to 4.26); of these, 7 samples (26.9%) had values exceeding the limit set by European Union regulations (2 ng/g). Additionally, AFB1 contamination in no rice sample exceeded the maximum limit accepted by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation (5 ng/g). This study showed that the mean EDI of AFB1 was 9 and 3 ng/kg bw/day for children and adults, respectively. In addition, the mean MOEs for children and adults were 18 and 64, respectively, indicating a public health concern. In addition, the present study showed that the risks of liver cancer associated with rice consumption among Iranian children and adults were 0.13 and 0.04 cancer cases/year/per 10<sup>5</sup> people, respectively.

    "title": "What is Fusarium forma specialis?",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "The forma specialis concept has been a cornerstone in <i>Fusarium</i> phytopathology for 85 years, classifying pathogens based on host specificity. However, its validity as a natural and practical framework has been increasingly questioned. In this study, we critically re-evaluate the forma specialis concept through an extensive survey of Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts from 23 provinces of China. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, morphological assessments, and pathogenicity tests on 659 strains isolated from 171 diseased samples, we identified 46 <i>Fusarium</i> species, including seven newly described taxa, and uncovered extensive cross-host pathogenicity, with up to 21 species associated with the same wilt disease. In addition, 57% of samples exhibited multiple species co-infections, revealing significant inconsistencies with the forma specialis framework. These findings challenge the long-standing paradigm of host specificity in <i>Fusarium</i> pathogens and advocate for a shift of perspective to a \"pathobiome\" framework, where disease dynamics are largely driven by community-level interactions rather than single-pathogen relationships. Applying these conceptual advances to Fusarium wilt research could fundamentally transform our comprehension of host-pathogen relationships and facilitate the development of more ecologically sustainable disease management approaches.",

    "title": "Pyruvate decarboxylase and its lysine succinylation contribute to the development and metabolite biosynthesis in pathogenic fungus Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "This study evaluates the effects of pyruvate decarboxylase and its lysine succinylation (Ksucc) on the development of Aspergillus flavus and the production of secondary metabolites. Mutant strains, including the knockout (\u2206pdc1), pdc1 point mutants (K258R and K258E) and complementary (\u2206pdc1.com) were constructed. The results showed that both \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains exhibited decreased conidiophore and conidia production and failed to generate sclerotia. The production of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was significantly increased in the \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains, while it decreased in the K258E strain. The results also indicate that pdc1 and its Ksucc are involved in the stress response and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Through GC-MS analysis, \u0394pdc1 was found to produce several significantly decreased compounds, including n-hexadecanoic acid, 2-bromotetradecane, and palmitic acid, among others. Additionally, different volatile metabolites, such as 1-iodo-decane, n, n-dimethyloctanamide and n, n-dimethyl-7-octynamide, were not detected in the \u0394pdc1 strain compared to WT and \u0394pdc1.com. HPLC results showed that the production of pyruvic acid, malic acid and succinic acid increased in both the \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains when compared to WT and \u0394pdc1.com strains. Comparative RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 3,817 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 1,913 up-regulated and 1,904 down-regulated genes in \u0394pdc1 vs. WT. These results suggest that PDC1 and K258 play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, development and stress responses of A. flavus.",

    "title": "Functionally redundant Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA regulate aflatoxin synthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus by controlling morphogenesis, oxidative balance and energy metabolism",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA exhibit significant sequence homology and are conserved across eukaryotic species. These proteins function as molecular switches within various signal transduction pathways by cycling between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. However, their specific functions in Aspergillus flavus remain largely unexplored. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizing 5S rRNA and tRNA-gRNA tandem arrays was developed, achieving over 95% single-gene and 75% double-gene editing efficiencies. Phenotypic and transcriptome analyses revealed significant functional redundancy between cdc42 and racA. In the mutants, conidia germination was markedly accelerated, with early germination driven by increased hydrolase activity and ATP levels. The loss of either cdc42 or racA resulted in reduced pathogenicity, compromised cell wall integrity, diminished aflatoxin production, and disrupted oxidative systems. These proteins regulate the generation of ROS through their interaction with NoxR, the regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase (Nox). Cdc42 and RacA exhibited opposing roles in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and pyruvate metabolism. The simultaneous loss of function in both genes is lethal, as evidenced by the inability of the \u2206cdc42racAtetOn mutant to grow on plates lacking doxycycline. The study reveals the critical roles of the closely related genes cdc42 and racA in the growth, development, and metabolism of A. flavus. These findings identify potential targets for mitigating the harmful effects of A. flavus and aflatoxins.",

    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Endogenous AICAR (acadesine) demonstrates significant therapeutic potential as a phase III clinical agent for the treatment of adverse cardiovascular reactions to coronary artery bypass grafting and as a phase I/II clinical agent for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains poorly defined. Our previous study demonstrated that AICAR was significantly enriched in the Fusarium solani mutant veAOE14, which overexpressed the global regulator VeA. We found that phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, viz., PRPS2 (PrsA) is regulated by VeA and involved in AICAR synthesis. Deletion of PRPS2 resulted in a significant 17% (\u03bcg/mg) reduction in AICAR production in the strain (p < 0.05), whereas its overexpression led to a statistically significant 1.2-fold increase in AICAR content (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we characterised the transcription factor MtfA, which inhibits the expression of PRPS2 gene and is negatively regulated by VeA. Further validation by yeast one-hybrid assay showed that MtfA directly regulated the PRPS2 gene, while AICAR was significantly increased in the mtfA deletion mutant. The above results indicate that the global regulator VeA negatively regulates the transcription factor MtfA, which in turn targets negatively regulating transcriptional levels of PRPS2 to mediate AICAR biosynthesis in F. solani.",
