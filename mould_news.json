    "excerpt": "Fusarium species are important opportunistic fungal pathogens. Diabetic foot infection (DFI) involves diverse causative pathogens however, the potential for fungal etiologies is often overlooked. We describe a case of DFI following foot trauma. Despite prior broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, the wound failed to heal and presented persistent swelling and pain. Microbiological re-evaluation and molecular identification confirmed the causative agent as Fusarium keratoplasticum (F. keratoplasticum), a pathogenic species within Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC). The isolate exhibited high MICs against most antifungals, thus systemic antifungal therapy was withheld. Successful management was achieved through systematic surgical debridement combined with silver-ion dressings, resulting in pathogen eradication and complete wound healing. Currently, F. keratoplasticum infections remain extremely limited, particularly those definitively confirmed to species level. This case broadens the pathogen spectrum of DFI and highlights the need for comprehensive etiologic evaluation in therapy-refractory wounds, offering a non-pharmacological strategy for resistant fungal infections.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease",
    "excerpt": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), primarily caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus, is a life-threatening fungal infection with high mortality rates. This study investigated novel resistance mechanisms to caspofungin (CAS) in clinical Aspergillus isolates with particular focus on genetic alterations in the CoQ5 gene and their functional implications. One hundred and forty-eight Aspergillus isolates from IPA cases were undergone antifungal susceptibility testing, genotyping and phylogenetic analyses, mutations and gene expression studies of Fks1 and CoQ5 genes, and three-dimensional structural analysis of wild-type and mutant CoQ5 proteins. The etiologic agents of IPA comprised A. flavus (72.3%) and A. fumigatus (27.7%). Caspofungin (CAS) resistance was reported in 7.4% of A. flavus and 9.7% of A. fumigatus isolates. Genetic analysis identified a novel mutation in the CoQ5 gene (T371C) resulting in an amino acid substitution (Y102H) in a CAS-resistant A. flavus isolate. Structural modeling suggests this variant may impair protein stability and mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to resistance through indirect mechanisms. The definitive establishment of causality and direct contribution of CoQ5 mutations to caspofungin susceptibility requires further functional validation by employing targeted genetic manipulation and phenotypic validation to directly interrogate the role of the Y102H variant in the resistance mechanism.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Environmental Pollution",
    "excerpt": "Fungal spores, a common component of biological air pollution, may negatively affect human health by triggering allergic symptoms. To assess the risk of exposure to allergens, abundant and highly allergenic Alternaria spp. and Cladosporium spp. spore concentrations are routinely measured, but almost exclusively on rooftops. In contrast, research on concentrations at ground-level, where people spend most of their time outdoors, is scarce. Although there is evidence that the main source of fungal spores is agricultural areas during harvest, it remains unclear how the proximity of crops influences ground-level spore concentrations. To address this, portable volumetric traps and meteorological stations were used to conduct three ground-level measurement campaigns (before, during, and after harvesting) throughout the main sporulation season in 2023. Nine sampling points in Pozna\u0144 (Poland) represented the main land use types: agricultural, urban, and forest. The maximum concentrations were 1,369 spores/m3 (Alternaria, 47% higher than the rooftop maximum) and 88,820 spores/m3 (Cladosporium, 458% higher), both recorded in agricultural areas. On average, concentrations of Cladosporium spores increased during harvest, whereas Alternaria concentrations substantially increased after harvest. The highest concentrations of Alternaria and Cladosporium spores were associated with air influxes from arable land (rho = 0.20 and 0.35, respectively) and grasslands (only Cladosporium, rho = 0.24). Overall, we successfully established an extensive, mobile, ground-level spore measurement network, which revealed differences in fungal spore concentrations across land-use types, harvest activities, and in comparison with regional-level measurements. This study represents an important step toward assessing airborne fungal spore concentrations relevant to human exposure.",

Herein, a green fungal flocculant was developed by cultivating Aspergillus niger using food waste hydrolysate as the sole substrate, achieving a biomass yield of 140.3\u202fmg/g-chemical oxygen demand. Alkaline modification effectively altered surface chemistry by degrading hydrophilic amide groups, enhancing hydrophobicity, surface charge repulsion, and hyphal dispersion. When applied as a coagulant aid with 3% FeCl3, the base-modified fungal flocculant markedly improved sludge dewatering, increasing Dx(90) from 102.0 to 1542.9\u202f\u03bcm and reducing specific resistance to filtration by 75.7%, with a final cake water content of 56.8%. Mechanistic analyses revealed that improved fungal network porosity, enhanced hydrophobic interactions, and coordination between fungal functional groups and Fe3+ ions synergistically facilitated water release. This bio-based strategy offers a sustainable alternative that simultaneously valorizes food waste and replaces synthetic polymeric flocculants in sludge treatment.",

    "excerpt": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination in edible oils poses significant health risks. Fe, N co-doped biochar (FeNBC) was synthesized from straw and integrated with sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation during oil aqueous refining. FeNBC activated sodium bisulfite to generate reactive oxygen species, degrading AFB1 that migrated into the aqueous phase. Over 98% of AFB1 (100\u00a0\u03bcg/L) was removed from oil within 50\u00a0min, with a reaction rate constant 3.02 times higher than that of pristine biochar and negligible impact on oil quality. Quenching and site-poisoning experiments identified Fe-Nx as the main catalytic site, with singlet oxygen and superoxide radical as the dominant active species. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that N-coordination modulates the Fe d-band center, facilitates charge redistribution, and promotes Fe valence cycling, thereby enhancing bisulfite adsorption and overcoming electron-transfer limitations during activation. This work provides a practical detoxification strategy and fundamental insights for designing food-compatible advanced oxidation technologies.",

Self-powered electrochemical sensor (SPES) has become a hot spot of research for its fast responses, simple operation and good stability. Herein, a dual-electrodes photocatalytic fuel cell-assisted self-powered electrochemical sensor (DPFC-SPES) was proposed for AFB1 detection by integrating fuel-free strategy with magnetic nanobeads (MBs)-assisted signal amplification strategy. The CdIn2S4/SnO2 heterojunction was constructed and enhanced photocurrent about 73-fold compared with SnO2. By introducing TaDp-COF-modified photocathode, DPFC-SPES with dual-electrodes boosted output potentials to 733.6\u00a0mV. The fuel-free strategy was proposed by utilizing cyclic reaction of photocathode and photoanode, greatly reducing battery internal resistance and saving energy. Moreover, MBs-assisted strategy was used to one-to-many signal amplification, realizing AFB1 detection with a detection limit down to 0.058\u00a0pg/mL. In addition, DPFC-SPES successfully achieved AFB1 detection in moldy corns, providing a further potent indication for food safety supervision and environmental monitoring areas.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Genetics and Biology",
    "excerpt": "Regulated cell death (RCD) is a highly conserved and coordinated cellular demise process. In animals, the fate of cells depends on the precise regulation of RCD, with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) playing a major role as negative regulators of cellular death. In fungi, RCD regulates crucial processes, including growth, development, stress response, host-pathogen interactions and more. However, the biochemical details of this process are not well understood in this kingdom. IAPs are, remarkably, one of the few RCD/Apoptosis-regulatory proteins that are conserved in fungi. Here, we performed large-scale bioinformatic analyses of IAPs in sequenced fungal genomes. While most fungal organisms have a single IAP gene (81.65\u00a0% of the genomes analyzed here), some fungi lack IAPs altogether and others have multiple IAP-like genes. Using the Aspergillus nidulans IAP, AnBir1, we show that this protein is required for survival and regulates cell death by inhibiting caspase-like activity. Moreover, disrupting RCD by constitutively expressing AnBir1 impacted fundamental processes, including development, stress response and secondary metabolism. We also show that fungal RCD can be hijacked for therapeutic purposes. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we targeted the AnBir1 homolog of the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SsBir1) during plant infection. Targeting SsBir1 resulted in enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum infection. We propose that IAPs play a critical role in regulating caspase activities and other RCD-related processes in fungi and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for fungal infections.",

Dipsacoside B (DB), a bioactive triterpenoid saponin from Flos Lonicerae (Shanyinhua), is recognized for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties. This study investigates the protective effects of DB against AFB1-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to control, AFB1, DB, and AFB1&#8201;+&#8201;DB groups, receiving oral treatments for 4 weeks. The results showed that DB significantly alleviated AFB1-induced weight loss and liver damage, as evidenced by histopathological changes and serum biochemical markers. DB reduced hepatic H&#8322;O&#8322; and MDA levels, enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as T-SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-1&#946;, and TNF-&#945; genes, and modulated metabolic enzymes by downregulating Phase I genes (CYP1A2, CYP3A11) while upregulating the Phase II gene GSTA3. Notably, DB upregulated AFB1-suppressed Nrf2 and its downstream targets (HO-1, NQO1, SOD1, GCLC, GCLM, GSS). DB also reversed AFB1-induced mitochondrial damage, including swelling and cristae disruption, and inhibited apoptosis by restoring Bcl-2 and reducing p53, Bax, Cyt-c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 expression. These findings suggest that DB protects against AFB1-induced liver injury by regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolic enzymes, suggesting it has significant potential as a therapeutic strategy for aflatoxin-related hepatic disorders.",

Lundquist\n\nCyanoglobules are lipid droplets of cyanobacteria that share compositional and functional features with plastoglobules of plant chloroplasts. However, their roles in stress physiology remain poorly defined, particularly in filamentous cyanobacteria. Here, we characterize cyanoglobule dynamics and composition during nitrogen starvation in a non-diazotrophic derivative of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. This experimental context enables analysis of sustained nitrogen deprivation in vegetative cells without the transient and heterogeneous effects of heterocyst differentiation and nitrogenase activity, while recognizing that the strain does not represent wild-type physiology. Nitrogen starvation induced striking morphological remodeling, including increased cyanoglobule size and abundance. Proteomic analysis revealed a cyanoglobule proteome enriched in homologs of the plant plastoglobule proteome as well as other redox regulators and isoprenoid metabolism enzymes, pointing to roles in pigment turnover and stress adaptation.

    "excerpt": "Mitochondria play a central role in fungal metabolism, adaptation, and pathogenesis, yet the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial genomes in plant-pathogenic Alternaria species remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative mitochondrial genomes analysis of five economically important Alternaria species-Alternaria burnsii, A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata, and A. gossypina-to investigate structural architecture, genomic variation, selection pressures, repeat element dynamics, and phylogenetic relationships. The mitochondrial genomes exhibited a conserved gene content of 13-14 core genes, 30-33 tRNA and 2 rRNA, but varied in size due to differences in intron insertions, intergenic spacers, and repetitive sequences. Strong A/U-biased codon usage was observed across species, consistent with high AT-richness and translational optimization. Purifying selection dominated across essential respiratory complexes (cox1-3, atp6-9 and cob), indicating functional constraint, while signals of positive selection and pseudogenization (disrupted rps3 in A. burnsii YUN-Z1107) suggest lineage-specific adaptations. We identified evolutionary hotspots in both coding and non-coding regions enriched with InDeLs and repeat expansions. A total of 920 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were annotated, with A. burnsii YUN-Z1107 showing the highest SSR density, particularly pentanucleotide motifs, implicating replication slippage in genome plasticity. Long repetitive elements were associated with intron mobility and possible recombination events, especially in A. arborescens YUN-Z0872. Phylogenomic analysis of 29 Ascomycota species confirmed a monophyletic Alternaria clade within Pleosporales, although limited resolution within the genus suggests complex evolutionary histories.

    "excerpt": "According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), 37\u00a0% of French dwellings are contaminated by molds, particularly Aspergillus species. Among these, Aspergillus creber is the most frequently detected in the bioaerosols of mold-damaged dwellings and may be contribute to various health disorders. In the context of climate change, with indoor temperatures potentially exceeding 28\u00a0\u00b0C in summer, and amid the ongoing energy crisis, the French government recommends maintaining indoor temperature at 19\u00a0\u00b0C. This raises concerns about the effects of climatic conditions i.e. temperature (T\u00b0) and relative humidity (RH), on fungal growth, sterigmatocystin (STE) production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these molds. We therefore cultured three reference strains of Aspergillus creber under four common dwelling conditions (A: 19\u00a0\u00b0C, 50\u00a0% RH; B 19\u00a0\u00b0C, 75\u00a0% RH; C: 28\u00a0\u00b0C, 50\u00a0% RH; D: 28\u00a0\u00b0C, 75\u00a0% RH) on five different culture media (MEA, MEA+10\u00a0% NaCl, CYA, CY20S, and M40Y). Temperature significantly influenced growth (mean diameters: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 22.8\u00a0mm; 28\u00a0\u00b0C: 34.4\u00a0mm; mean biomasses: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 108.3\u00a0mg; 28\u00a0\u00b0C: 329.1\u00a0mg), STE production (mean concentrations: 19\u00a0\u00b0C: 3.5\u00a0\u03bcg/g/28\u00a0\u00b0C: 34.5\u00a0\u03bcg/g), and the MICs of antifungal agents, with a notable association between increased temperature and elevated MICs. The highest STE production (up to 99\u00a0\u03bcg/g) occurred at 28\u00a0\u00b0C on M40Y agar. Positive correlations were observed between diameters and biomass (r\u00a0=\u00a00.791; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), diameters and STE production (r\u00a0=\u00a00.431; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and biomass and STE production (r\u00a0=\u00a00.305; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), suggesting a strong link between primary growth and secondary metabolism. These findings highlight the potential health risks posed by rising indoor temperatures, as projected under global climate change, which may lead to increased STE production in Aspergillus creber.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Fusarium wilt, commonly referred to as Panama disease, stands as the most catastrophic disease in banana cultivation. Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), it has imposed substantial economic burdens on banana farmers worldwide. Foc4-SIX13 was identified as a potential effector in Foc4, and is characterized by secretion into xylem. It is a protein comprised of 312 amino acids, and features a functional signal peptide without recognizable motifs or domains. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the expression of Foc4-SIX13 was markedly upregulated during the initial stage of fungal infection in banana plants. Through homologous recombination, the successful knockout of Foc4-SIX13 was accomplished. The resulting deletion mutant exhibited impaired mycelial growth and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress, coupled with a significant decrease in pathogenicity towards bananas. Foc4-SIX13\u0394sp could not induce cellular necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that Foc4-SIX13\u0394sp was localized in both cytoplasm and nuclei of N. benthamiana cells. The interaction between Foc4-SIX13 and banana Nudix hydrolase 23 (Ma-NUD23) was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Taken together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Foc4-SIX13 in the pathogenicity of Foc4 and its importance in the Fusarium infection process. Consequently, Foc4-SIX13 is proposed as a promising target for future management strategies against Fusarium wilt, and it can provide a novel avenue for the breeding of banana varieties with enhanced disease resistance.",

However, the unstable nature and insufficient activity of the FAD-dependent dimer hinder the antibacterial capacity. In this study, A GOX from Aspergillus eucalypticola (AeGOXL), outstanding for its catalytic efficiency, was selected for laboratory evolution through random mutagenesis. Three thermostable variants Q148K, H283Y, and P514K were selected and form the combined variant Q148K/H283Y (M1), superior in both thermostability (T50 increased 13\u202f\u00b0C, Tm increased 6.7\u202f\u00b0C, and 2.1-fold of t1/2 prolonged at 80\u202f\u00b0C) and catalytic activity (97% and 57% increase in specific activity and kcat/Km), comparing with the WT. Structural investigations elucidated the molecular stabilization due to additional hydrogen bond network formation, while long-range interaction elevated the flexibility of key residues, improving the substrate affinity. For antibacterial capacity, M1 significantly brought down the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli separately to 21.3 and 17.4\u202fmg/L (52.5% and 70.5% lower than the WT, comparable to sensitive conventional antibiotics), in accordance with the electron microscope manifestation. This research delved into the GOX functional based enzymatic antibacterial approaches, providing milder and more eco-friendly substrate to address antibacterial requirements.",

    "excerpt": "The capacity of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> to cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis depends on its ability to adapt to dynamic and stressful microenvironments within the host. Epigenetic regulation, including histone deacetylation, plays a critical role in fungal adaptation to stress. Here, we investigated the role of the class I histone deacetylase HosA in <i>A. fumigatus</i> stress resistance, host cell interactions, and virulence. A \u0394<i>hosA</i> mutant had increased susceptibility to intracellular oxidant stress induced by menadione. It also had impaired capacity to invade and damage two pulmonary epithelial cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. In a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model of invasive aspergillosis, mice infected with the \u0394<i>hosA</i> mutant survived significantly longer than those infected with the wild-type strain, despite having similar pulmonary fungal burden. The \u0394<i>hosA</i> mutant also induced a weaker inflammatory response than the wild-type strain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HosA regulates genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and energy metabolism, functioning as both an activator and repressor of distinct gene sets. Collectively, these results indicate that HosA is a key epigenetic regulator that governs <i>A. fumigatus</i> interactions with host cells and virulence during invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.IMPORTANCEEpigenetic modifications in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> can be induced by environmental changes and stresses such as those induced by interaction with host cells. HosA, a class I histone deacetylase, has been shown to play a key role in regulating secondary metabolism in several <i>Aspergillus</i> species, but its function in <i>A. fumigatus</i> was previously unknown.

    "excerpt": "Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea has a severe impact on postharvest green beans, leading to quality degradation and substantial economic losses. The application of plant endophytic microorganisms has proven to be a reliable and safe strategy for controlling fungal diseases. In the present study, an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9, was isolated from healthy bean seeds and exhibited strong inhibitory activity against Botrytis cinerea. This strain could form biofilms, enhance the activity of defense enzymes, and boost the content of active secondary metabolites in green beans. The crude lipopeptide extracts from NEAU-HLD-9 remarkably suppressed the mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea. It is worth noting that the crude lipopeptide extracts also effectively controlled gray mold in green beans by reducing both disease incidence and lesion diameter. PCR and LC-MS analyses suggested that the crude lipopeptide extracts comprised two antifungal compounds. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the strain contained 15 gene clusters responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis, including those for antifungal compounds. In summary, both Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9 and its crude lipopeptide extracts strongly inhibited Botrytis cinerea in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a promising approach for the management of gray mold in green beans.",

Additionally, 2-Phenylethanol generated by A. pullulans S2 exhibited strong antifungal properties by disrupting the cell membrane integrity and promoting reactive oxygen species accumulation in pathogens. Furthermore, a lyophilized formulation of A. pullulans S2 was developed using an optimized protective agent combination via response surface methodology. This resulted in a high post-lyophilization survival rate of 85.2\u00a0% and significant biocontrol efficacy after 90 days of storage.

This study proposes a strategy based on self-supervised learning (SSL) for the accurate detection of Aflatoxin B1 in peanuts and maize.

Secondly, the spectral reconstruction error was innovatively used as a wavelength attention mechanism, integrated with the fine-tuned encoder from the SSL stage to develop a classification model. This model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9805\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0019 in peanuts and 0.9478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0060 in maize, outperforming other deep learning models.

Tumor is indeed able to shape a self-permissive TME, reprogramming the cellular components into allies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), abundant in BC TME, mainly acquire an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype able to fuel tumor progression, immune evasion, metastasis and therapy resistance through a dynamic crosstalk with cancer cells. MicroRNAs, transferred via extracellular vesicles and exploited by the tumor to mold an immunesuppressive niche, act as central mediators of this bidirectional communication: tumor-derived miRNAs can reprogram macrophages toward an M2-like functional program, and TAM-derived miRNAs in turn promote and sustain cancer cell progression. This miRNA-orchestrated plasticity highlights TAMs as key TME regulators. Clinically, miRNA modulation offers promising strategies for TAM reprogramming, alongside their utility as prognostic biomarkers. Integrating miRNA-targeted TME interventions with conventional therapies holds the potential to overcome resistance in high-TAM B",

    "excerpt": "This study was conducted in Addis Ababa, surrounding peri-urban and urban feed markets to assess the prevalence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and identify fungal diversity in livestock feeds. Two hundred and ninety samples of oil seed cakes and formulated feeds were collected from the randomly selected feed vendors. The samples were analysed for aflatoxin B1 using a Helica&#174; Aflatoxin B1 (low matrix) Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit. To validate the ELISA results, a subset of randomly selected samples was further analysed using High-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). The results indicated that 92% of poultry ration, 72% of dairy ration, 66% of linseed cake, 64% of noug seed cake, 61% of cotton seed cake, and 36% of soybean cake were contaminated with AFB1 exceeding the permissible level (20&amp;nbsp;&#181;g/kg)&amp;nbsp;in Ethiopia. To evaluate fungal diversity, genomic DNA was extracted, pooled by feed type, and sequenced. The findings revealed variations in the diversity indices of fungal phyla, families, genera and species. The Metabarcoding results revealed Ascomycota as the dominant phylum in all feeds, with Aspergillaceae, Nectriaceae, Botyosphaeriaceae, and Cladosporiaceae being the dominant families. Aspergillaceae accounts for 53%, 43%, 16%, 33%, 11%, and 28% of the total fungal contamination detected in cotton seed cake (S1), noug seed cake (S2), soybean cake (S3), linseed cake (S4), poultry ration (S5), and dairy ration (S6), respectively. The synergistic presence of multiple fungal species, some of which are known to be harmful, was identified in the feed samples.

Despite being efficient, BTKi have also been associated with significant side effects, including arrhythmias, hemorrhagic complications, and opportunistic infections. Zanubrutinib is a second-generation BTKi that recently received FDA approval for CLL and is associated with improved outcomes and a better safety profile compared to first-generation BTKi. In the present study, we report a case of a patient with CLL, with an in-range absolute neutrophil count and an isolated Aspergillus fumigatus brain abscess mimicking a brain tumor. The lesion was excised \"en bloc\", and lesion cultures revealed Aspergillus fumigatus sensitive to amphotericin and voriconazole. The patient received postoperative treatment with voriconazole. While invasive fungal infections with brain involvement have been previously reported, to our knowledge, this is the first documented case of an isolated Aspergillus fumigatus brain abscess in a patient receiving zanubrutinib.",

    "excerpt": "The widespread use of polypropylene-based surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated environmental plastic pollution, necessitating sustainable degradation strategies. This study investigates the biodegradation potential of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii on nonwoven polypropylene mask layers under both nutrient-rich (MSM broth) and soil microcosm conditions. A multidisciplinary approach combining weight loss measurements, FTIR-ATR spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize physical, chemical, and biochemical changes in the polymer matrix. Results show that A. bridgerii induced significant degradation in both environments, with the highest weight loss % observed in MSM microcosms (20.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u202f%), indicating active fragmentation and partial mineralization. In soil microcosms, fungal inoculation led to the most advanced oxidation (SAUB CI up to \u223c4.6), extensive surface fragmentation, and the release of unique volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including DEHP (\u223c15\u202f% GC-MS area) and long-chain ketones. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by the lowest residual mask mass (9.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u202f%), suggesting enhanced mineralization in the nutrient-limited soil. SEM analysis further confirmed pronounced fiber degradation and biofilm formation. These findings underscore the role of fungal metabolism and environmental context in modulating polypropylene decay, supporting a multiple mechanistic process such as oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation. The integration of FTIR, SEM, and GC-MS provided robust evidence of mask polymer degradation and highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii as a bioremediation agent for PPE waste.",

Overexpression of the C4 dicarboxylate transporter C4T318 from Aspergillus oryzae enhanced malic acid secretion, while medium optimization under buffered conditions further improved the production. The engineered strain efficiently assimilated representative lignin-derived aromatics, including 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid, producing up to 3.9 g/L malic acid. Conversion of BCD lignin liquors from poplar and sorghum demonstrated effective utilization of heterogeneous aromatic mixtures, generating up to 0.82 g/L malic acid.

It regulates the response to oxidative stress, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, as well as affects the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which plays a pivotal role in protecting against chemicals and contaminants present in the diet. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and alternariol (AOH) are quite well-known, no research so far has considered the possibility that high glucose concentration might affect the response of CRC cells to mycotoxins. In this study, we evaluated how high glucose condition (50 mmol/L) modulates the effect of two mycotoxins distinct in toxicity and underlying mechanisms: DON (0.1\u20131 \u03bcmol/L) and AOH (0.1\u201320 \u03bcmol/L). We evaluated the migration and invasion in Caco-2 and HT-29 CRC cell lines, impact on barrier integrity and metabolism of mycotoxins in an intestinal in vitro co-culture model comprising Caco-2/HT-29-MTX-E12/CCD-18Co.

    "excerpt": "SUMMARYIatrogenic central nervous system mold infections (ICNSMIs) are rare and occur as sporadic complications of neurosurgical procedures or device insertions. However, recent outbreaks have been reported in outpatient settings, following epidural injections with contaminated medicines. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies published without date restrictions through July 2025 on ICNSMIs. We identified 905 cases of such infections, with 4% occurring in non-outbreak settings and 96% associated with five documented outbreaks. In both non-outbreak and outbreak settings, infections were more common after spinal/epidural injections, with contaminated medicines or supplies being the primary source. Due to their angioinvasive tendencies, ICNSMI caused by <i>Fusarium solani</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> species had a higher frequency of stroke/intracranial hemorrhage (<i>P</i> = 0.011), aneurysm formation (<i>P</i> = 0.012), and resulted in higher mortality compared with ICNSMI caused by other molds (<i>P</i> < 0.001). ICNSMI, as a result of catheter-associated fungemia, was very rare (only one case). Strategies to identify ICNSMI in exposed individuals during an outbreak have included (i) symptom-driven lumbar puncture, (ii) screening lumbar puncture regardless of symptoms, and (iii) screening brain MRI regardless of symptoms. Measurement of (1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid was a valuable tool to diagnose ICNSMI preemptively. Outcomes of ICNSMI following neurosurgical procedures were poor (90-day mortality of 35%) and depended on the route of inoculation, mold species, timing of diagnosis, and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy in combination with source control. Patients with ICNSMI often suffered long-term neurologic sequelae, even with the most optimal management strategies.",

    "title": "Contribution of terrestrial processes in reducing environmental mycotoxin levels: a review on mycotoxin-soil interactions",
    "source": "Latest Results",
    "excerpt": "Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that can harm humans and animals. They occur primarily in infected crops, with higher levels under environmental stress. Their origin in contaminated crops is the main contributor to soil contamination. Although high levels can be detected in soils, these are transitory and in average far lower than in contaminated crops, indicating a key role of functioning soils in down-regulating environmental mycotoxin levels. This review examines mycotoxin-soil interactions in terms of four terrestrial processes: (i) adsorption to soil fractions, (ii) microbial transformation and mineralisation (iii) transport/mobilization with water, (iv) plant uptake and response. Results show that the main process for dissipation in soils is microbial, improved by biomass and activity and by a narrow fungi-to-bacteria ratio. This aligns with incubation studies suggesting a key role of bacteria in the degradation of mycotoxins. This path is favoured by the availability of the mycotoxins, that can be reduced by the adsorption to soil particles: the aromatic character and the carbonyl functions are decisive for adsorption to soil organic matter and clay particles, respectively. Consequently, mycotoxin levels in environmental compartments can be interpreted as the (net) result of entry and dissipation processes mediated through the soil, rather than the soil acting as a source of them. Plant uptake represents a minor pathway of contamination compared to the in situ production. In soil-plant systems, suboptimal nitrogen (N) and pesticide management are factors triggering fungal infestation and mycotoxins levels. Fungal infestation and mycotoxin can induce the polyphenolic response of the plant, along with mycotoxin metabolization as reported for DON. Based on this newly-made interpretation, this review provides future perspectives on mycotoxin occurrence and fate under climate change and intensive agriculture and proposes soil-based strategies for an integral env",

    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), a potent mycotoxin frequently detected in improperly stored poultry feed, induces hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa , exhibits strong antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory activities; however, its efficacy and mechanisms in mitigating AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity in broilers remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary CUR supplementation on growth performance and liver health of broilers exposed to AFB 1 . RESULTS A total of 720 broilers (eight replicates of 15 birds each per treatment) were fed a basal diet, an AFB\u2081\u2010contaminated diet (1 mg kg \u22121 ), or AFB 1 diets supplemented with CUR (100, 300, or 500 mg kg \u22121 ) for 42 days. AFB 1 exposure significantly reduced average daily gain and increased feed conversion ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas CUR supplementation \u2013 particularly 300\u2013500 mg kg \u22121 \u2013 improved growth performance relative to the AFB 1 group ( P &lt; 0.05). CUR also decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, alleviated hepatic histopathological damage, enhanced hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), and suppressed malondialdehyde accumulation ( P &lt; 0.01). At the molecular level, CUR upregulated Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes while downregulating NOD\u2010like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase\u20101, and interleukin\u20101\u03b2, indicating attenuation of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Dietary curcumin effectively mitigated AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity and performance loss in broilers through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings highlight CUR as a promising natural feed additive for protecting poultry against mycotoxin\u2010induced oxidative and inflammatory damage. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study evaluated the efficacy of ipflufenoquin, a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, against fungal pathogens isolated from Korean strawberry fields in 2023. Ipflufenoquin demonstrated a high <i>in vitro</i> sensitivity to <i>B. cinerea</i> and broad activity against other pathogens.

However, treatment shifted the fungal community, promoting less sensitive genera, such as <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Rhizopus</i>. Structural modeling with AlphaFold2 and molecular docking confirmed that ipflufenoquin binds to the quinone binding tunnel of DHODH, correlating binding affinity with susceptibility. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that ipflufenoquin suppresses primary metabolic pathways while triggering a robust stress response, up-regulating detoxification and efflux transporter genes. This integrated study confirms the efficacy of ipflufenoquin against gray mold and elucidates its molecular impacts, offering essential data for sustainable management strategies.",

Plant-derived ingredients serve as major protein sources in aquaculture feeds; however, the increasing use of insects as alternative nutrient sources introduces additional potential pathways for mycotoxin contamination. Strong evidence shows that exposure of fish to mycotoxins can negatively affect their health, leading to reduced growth, impaired immune response and reproductive disorders. However, knowledge of the effects of mycotoxins on farmed insects is still limited. Little is known about the insect metabolism of mycotoxins and their transfer to animal feed, which constitutes a weakness of safety assessments of insects as feed components. This review provides comprehensive information about the consequences of mycotoxin contamination of feed materials and feeds used in aquaculture. To facilitate understanding of the problem and its scale, the mycotoxin levels in plant materials and finished feeds used in aquaculture were compiled and analyzed together with the contamination levels of fish-derived food. Moreover, the available data on the effects of fish exposure to the selected mycotoxins are summarized, highlighting the complexity of the biological activity of these compounds. Finally, recent challenges to the safety of using insects as a protein source in fish nutrition are discussed.

Our previous study identified novel basidiomycete-specific chss (chsb) clades (BI&#8211;BIII) and suggested functional differences between the chsb genes of clade BII and BIII. This study, together with our previous work, presents the first comprehensive functional analysis and identification of clade-specific roles of chsb genes in vegetative hyphae of the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. Using homologous recombination, we disrupted chsb1 (clade BI) and simultaneously disrupted chsb2 and chsb3 (clade BII) to investigate their roles in vegetative growth, cell wall biosynthesis and stress response. Deletion of chsb1 led to reduced colony growth, impaired aerial hyphae formation, thinner cell walls and significant cell wall remodelling. In contrast, single disruptions of chsb2 or chsb3 caused mild phenotypes, while double disruption of these genes resulted in severe growth defects, complete loss of aerial hyphae, and abnormal septation.

However, the reason for the TLO gene expansion remains unclear, and the current study aimed to determine if reduction in the TLO family copy number affected virulence. In order to investigate this, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to generate two TLO-depleted mutants: one mutant retaining only TLO&#946;2 (CaTLO2) and the second mutant containing only TLO&#947;5 (CaTLO5). Both TLO-depleted mutants exhibited increased filamentous growth, increased susceptibility to specific stresses and reduced virulence in a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). In vitro, the CaTLO5 mutant also exhibited impaired hyphal escape from macrophages and reduced hyphal invasion of oral keratinocytes.

    "excerpt": "Mycotoxins pose a major health risk for humans in many parts of the world. For exposure assessment human biomonitoring (HBM) based on the analysis of serum, plasma, whole blood, urine or breast milk samples is a powerful approach which has been extensively used. However, there are several major challenges and pitfalls to be considered to achieve reliable and standardized data which can be used for risk assessment. These challenges include sampling (spot urine, 24\u00a0h urine, plasma, serum etc.) and analytical issues (missing reference standards, matrix effects, protein adducts, recovery, limit of detection, stability during storage, etc.). Further critical aspects needed for biomarker interpretation and human health risk evaluation are a lack of data for several mycotoxins such as (a) health-based guidance values (b) long-term biomarkers, (c) reliable food intake data (d) toxicokinetic parameters in humans, for example clearance and transfer rates to urine or milk and (e) HBM guidance values. In this review, these issues will be discussed based on recent HBM studies and recommendations for future studies as well as research needs will be derived.\n                Graphical abstract",

    "excerpt": "This study aimed to optimize a solid-state fermentation approach to produce valuable substances from two grape pomace (GP) varieties fermented with two Aspergillus strains (A. oryzae and A. tamarii) with aqueous extract samples collected over 6 days. The aqueous extracts were characterized by \u00b0Brix, pH, titratable acidity, total phenolics, 4 individual sugars, 5 organic acids, and 4 phenolics. The results showed \u00b0Brix, pH, and titratable acidity changed monotonically with fermentation, corresponding to changes in individual sugars and organic acids. Fermentation nearly depleted fructose (98\u201399%), glucose (>99%), and tartaric acid (62\u201399%), lowering \u00b0Brix and titratable acidity while raising pH. Fermentation also significantly increased gallic acid (124\u2013159%) and produced kojic acid (0.041 g/g pomace dry mass). Phenolic extraction was maximized with 1\u20133 days of fermentations. The PCA biplot showed that fermentation duration and GP variety were the primary drivers of variation in chemical composition, while strain type had minimal impact.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus ), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% \u00b1 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% \u00b1 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% \u00b1 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1\u20132) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% \u00b1 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3\u20135 (F1 92.1% \u00b1 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for laboratories lacking specialized mycology expertise, especially in resource-limited settings.

    "title": "GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide homeostasis and involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus . Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus ; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus . This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy",

    "excerpt": "Emerging mycotoxins are defined as fungal metabolites not yet regulated or routinely monitored&#8212;are gaining attention due to their potential health impacts and widespread occurrence in food and feed. These emerging mycotoxins are known to exert diverse in vitro toxic effects. Furthermore, they share relevant antimicrobial properties, which may affect intestinal microbiota and hence gut health, immunity and animal welfare, particularly in herbivorous species. Despite growing interest in small herbivorous pets such as rabbits and rodents, limited data are available on mycotoxin contamination in their commercial diets. This study aimed to develop and validate a reliable LC&#8211;MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of selected emerging mycotoxins&#8212;such as beauvericin (BEAU), enniatins (ENN A, A1, B, B1), and alternariol (AOH)&#8212;in rabbit and rodent feed. A total of 200 feed samples (100 each for rabbit and rodent feed) were randomly collected from pet shops and markets in Bangkok, Thailand. Sample preparation was based on the QuEChERS approach, and detection was performed using liquid chromatography&#8211;tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Method validation was conducted according to SANTE/11,312/2021 guidelines, demonstrating acceptable performance in terms of selectivity, linearity, recovery, precision, and LOQ. The results revealed contamination with at least one emerging mycotoxin in 50% of rabbit feed and 39% of rodent feed samples, with BEAU being the most frequently detected compound. Co-contamination of BEAU and ENNs was found in 13.2% of rabbit feed and 8.2% of rodent feed samples, while AOH was not detected. These findings highlight the need for routine monitoring of emerging mycotoxins in pet food, especially for herbivorous small pets that may be rather vulnerable to microbiota-disrupting agents.

    "excerpt": "<i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (<i>A. flavus</i>) is a plant pathogenic fungus that produces toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxins, posing a threat to food safety and human health. As a kind of food additive, phytic acid (PA) exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity. However, the antifungal effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> are not well understood. Here, transcriptomic and biochemical analyses were carried out to investigate the inhibitory effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> and potential mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that PA effectively inhibited the vegetative growth, conidiation and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production of <i>A. flavus</i>. In addition, we found that PA also suppressed the pathogenicity of <i>A. flavus</i> on peanut and maize seeds. The transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, oxidative stress, ergosterol biosynthesis, and the MAPK signalling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i>. Biochemical experiments further demonstrated that PA could destroy cell membrane integrity and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, eventually resulting in defects of development and AFB1 biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>. Taken together, this research enhances understanding of the antifungal mechanism of PA, and provides novel insights into its potential as a food additive to prevent and control <i>A. flavus</i> contamination.",

Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a public health concern, especially in countries where rice is a staple food, due to its carcinogenic, acute, and chronic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentration levels of AFB1 in domestic (Iranian) rice samples. The presence and mean concentration of AFB1 in 70 Iranian rice samples collected from local markets in Tehran, Iran were measured using a competitive ELISA method. Furthermore, a health risk assessment was performed based on estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFB1 from rice consumption, margin of exposure (MOE), and liver cancer risk in Iranian children and adults. AFB1 was detected in 26 samples (37.1%) with the mean concentration levels of 1.86 \u00b1 0.67 ng/g (ranges from 1.12 to 4.26); of these, 7 samples (26.9%) had values exceeding the limit set by European Union regulations (2 ng/g). Additionally, AFB1 contamination in no rice sample exceeded the maximum limit accepted by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation (5 ng/g). This study showed that the mean EDI of AFB1 was 9 and 3 ng/kg bw/day for children and adults, respectively. In addition, the mean MOEs for children and adults were 18 and 64, respectively, indicating a public health concern. In addition, the present study showed that the risks of liver cancer associated with rice consumption among Iranian children and adults were 0.13 and 0.04 cancer cases/year/per 10<sup>5</sup> people, respectively.

Remarkably, all three species produced both sexual and asexual morphs under laboratory conditions, providing rare insights into reproductive modes within <i>Alternaria</i>, where sexual morphs are rarely observed. Phylogenetic analyses based on five gene regions (ITS-rDNA, <i>GAPDH, TEF1, RPB2</i>, and <i>Alt a 1</i>) clarified their evolutionary relationships and supported species delimitation. Phylogenetic trees constructed using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference consistently resolved each species as a distinct monophyletic lineage within <i>Alternaria</i> section <i>Nimbya</i>. These findings reveal previously unrecognized <i>Alternaria</i> diversity on Cyperaceae hosts and underscore the value of combining morphological observations with multilocus phylogenetic approaches to resolve taxonomic complexities in <i>Alternaria</i>.",

    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Three previously undescribed phenolic bisabolane sesquiterpenoids (PBS) including a pair of new enantiomers (\u00b1)-aspersydonol A (1a/1b) and aspersydonol B (2), along with 12 known analogs (3\u201314) were isolated from the marine-associated fungus Aspergillus sydowii LF51 guided by a combined application of molecular networking and Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART) approaches. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Compound 2 represents the first example of natural PBS with a hexahydrodibenzo[b,d]furan skeleton. Antifungal assays revealed that compounds 3, 6, 9, and 11 exhibited moderate activities against Cryptococcus spp. (MICs = 32\u201364 \u03bcg/mL), with additive effects against Cryptococcus gattii R265 combined with Amphotericin B (AmB), reducing MICs to 4\u201332 \u03bcg/mL. Compound 9 showed an additive effect with fluconazole (FLC) against C. gattii R265, lowering its MIC to 2 \u03bcg/mL. Mechanistic studies revealed that compound 9 inhibited C. gattii R265 by suppressing urease activity, disrupting membrane integrity, and inducing oxidative damage via ROS accumulation. Furthermore, compound 3 displayed moderate antibacterial efficacy against Mycobacterium smegmatis.",

    "title": "What is Fusarium forma specialis?",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "The forma specialis concept has been a cornerstone in <i>Fusarium</i> phytopathology for 85 years, classifying pathogens based on host specificity. However, its validity as a natural and practical framework has been increasingly questioned. In this study, we critically re-evaluate the forma specialis concept through an extensive survey of Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts from 23 provinces of China. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, morphological assessments, and pathogenicity tests on 659 strains isolated from 171 diseased samples, we identified 46 <i>Fusarium</i> species, including seven newly described taxa, and uncovered extensive cross-host pathogenicity, with up to 21 species associated with the same wilt disease. In addition, 57% of samples exhibited multiple species co-infections, revealing significant inconsistencies with the forma specialis framework. These findings challenge the long-standing paradigm of host specificity in <i>Fusarium</i> pathogens and advocate for a shift of perspective to a \"pathobiome\" framework, where disease dynamics are largely driven by community-level interactions rather than single-pathogen relationships. Applying these conceptual advances to Fusarium wilt research could fundamentally transform our comprehension of host-pathogen relationships and facilitate the development of more ecologically sustainable disease management approaches.",

    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "This study evaluates the effects of pyruvate decarboxylase and its lysine succinylation (Ksucc) on the development of Aspergillus flavus and the production of secondary metabolites. Mutant strains, including the knockout (\u2206pdc1), pdc1 point mutants (K258R and K258E) and complementary (\u2206pdc1.com) were constructed. The results showed that both \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains exhibited decreased conidiophore and conidia production and failed to generate sclerotia. The production of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was significantly increased in the \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains, while it decreased in the K258E strain. The results also indicate that pdc1 and its Ksucc are involved in the stress response and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Through GC-MS analysis, \u0394pdc1 was found to produce several significantly decreased compounds, including n-hexadecanoic acid, 2-bromotetradecane, and palmitic acid, among others. Additionally, different volatile metabolites, such as 1-iodo-decane, n, n-dimethyloctanamide and n, n-dimethyl-7-octynamide, were not detected in the \u0394pdc1 strain compared to WT and \u0394pdc1.com. HPLC results showed that the production of pyruvic acid, malic acid and succinic acid increased in both the \u0394pdc1 and K258R strains when compared to WT and \u0394pdc1.com strains. Comparative RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 3,817 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 1,913 up-regulated and 1,904 down-regulated genes in \u0394pdc1 vs. WT. These results suggest that PDC1 and K258 play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, development and stress responses of A. flavus.",

    "title": "Functionally redundant Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA regulate aflatoxin synthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus by controlling morphogenesis, oxidative balance and energy metabolism",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA exhibit significant sequence homology and are conserved across eukaryotic species. These proteins function as molecular switches within various signal transduction pathways by cycling between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. However, their specific functions in Aspergillus flavus remain largely unexplored. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizing 5S rRNA and tRNA-gRNA tandem arrays was developed, achieving over 95% single-gene and 75% double-gene editing efficiencies. Phenotypic and transcriptome analyses revealed significant functional redundancy between cdc42 and racA. In the mutants, conidia germination was markedly accelerated, with early germination driven by increased hydrolase activity and ATP levels. The loss of either cdc42 or racA resulted in reduced pathogenicity, compromised cell wall integrity, diminished aflatoxin production, and disrupted oxidative systems. These proteins regulate the generation of ROS through their interaction with NoxR, the regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase (Nox). Cdc42 and RacA exhibited opposing roles in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and pyruvate metabolism. The simultaneous loss of function in both genes is lethal, as evidenced by the inability of the \u2206cdc42racAtetOn mutant to grow on plates lacking doxycycline. The study reveals the critical roles of the closely related genes cdc42 and racA in the growth, development, and metabolism of A. flavus. These findings identify potential targets for mitigating the harmful effects of A. flavus and aflatoxins.",

    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Endogenous AICAR (acadesine) demonstrates significant therapeutic potential as a phase III clinical agent for the treatment of adverse cardiovascular reactions to coronary artery bypass grafting and as a phase I/II clinical agent for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains poorly defined. Our previous study demonstrated that AICAR was significantly enriched in the Fusarium solani mutant veAOE14, which overexpressed the global regulator VeA. We found that phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, viz., PRPS2 (PrsA) is regulated by VeA and involved in AICAR synthesis. Deletion of PRPS2 resulted in a significant 17% (\u03bcg/mg) reduction in AICAR production in the strain (p < 0.05), whereas its overexpression led to a statistically significant 1.2-fold increase in AICAR content (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we characterised the transcription factor MtfA, which inhibits the expression of PRPS2 gene and is negatively regulated by VeA. Further validation by yeast one-hybrid assay showed that MtfA directly regulated the PRPS2 gene, while AICAR was significantly increased in the mtfA deletion mutant. The above results indicate that the global regulator VeA negatively regulates the transcription factor MtfA, which in turn targets negatively regulating transcriptional levels of PRPS2 to mediate AICAR biosynthesis in F. solani.",
