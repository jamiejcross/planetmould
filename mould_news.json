    "excerpt": "Alternaria alternata causes serious postharvest diseases in tomatoes, threatening shelf life and food safety. In this study, a natural and eco-friendly strategy was developed using Ligusticum jeholense essential oil (LEO), extracted via optimized enzymatic-deep eutectic solvent microwave-assisted method (EDP-MAHD), which achieved a 3.38-fold higher yield than conventional extraction. GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC\u2085\u2080, 0.0718 \u03bcL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

In this study, we assessed the toxicological relationship between a commonly found indoor mold species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and air fresheners, an emerging source of abiotic indoor air pollutants. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of mold and two air fresheners (Brands A and B) on A549 cells and then tested the effect of co-exposure to the two toxicants on various cellular responses. We also analyzed the chemical composition of the air fresheners using LC-MS. Our results show that both air fresheners were composed of several compounds that could inhibit mold growth and pose health risks to humans. Furthermore, the chemical composition and concentration of the air freshener solutions could influence the toxicological interactions. Overall, our study demonstrates the need for further research on these interactions for a comprehensive assessment of indoor air health impacts. The knowledge will also allow air freshener manufacturers to formulate products with minimal health impacts.",

It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000\u202fnM\u202fT-2 toxin for 48 and 72\u202fh. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay.

However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with \u226515% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria \u22651 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had \u22652 criteria involving \u22652 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (\u22655) (P < 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus, and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure\u2013function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "excerpt": "Peanut root rot (PRR), caused by Fusarium solani, is a common and destructive disease. Cyclobutrifluram exhibits antifungal activity against Fusarium spp., yet its bioactivity and resistance risk against F. solani remain unclear. In this study, the EC50 values of cyclobutrifluram against 155 F. solani strains ranged from 0.0279 to 0.1102 \u03bcg/mL, with a mean of 0.0513 \u00b1 0.0170 \u03bcg/mL. Treatment with cyclobutrifluram significantly inhibited conidial production and germination, reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, increased hyphal branching, and shortened the distance between septa or cell nuclei. Cyclobutrifluram provided excellent control over PRR. Seven laboratory-generated cyclobutrifluram-resistant mutants showed no or slight fitness penalties and exhibited positive cross-resistance only with pydiflumetofen, indicating a moderate-to-high resistance risk. Resistance to cyclobutrifluram in F. solani was conferred by four SDH substitutions (FsSdhBH248Y, FsSdhC1A83V, FsSdhC2A85V, and FsSdhDD184G), which was confirmed by molecular docking and gene replacement.

This study evaluated the efficacy of ipflufenoquin, a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, against fungal pathogens isolated from Korean strawberry fields in 2023. Ipflufenoquin demonstrated a high in vitro sensitivity to B. cinerea and broad activity against other pathogens. Fruit and greenhouse trials confirmed its robust control of gray mold, including strains resistant to multiple fungicide classes. However, treatment shifted the fungal community, promoting less sensitive genera, such as Cladosporium and Rhizopus. Structural modeling with AlphaFold2 and molecular docking confirmed that ipflufenoquin binds to the quinone binding tunnel of DHODH, correlating binding affinity with susceptibility. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that ipflufenoquin suppresses primary metabolic pathways while triggering a robust stress response, up-regulating detoxification and efflux transporter genes. This integrated study confirms the efficacy of ipflufenoquin against gray mold and elucidates its molecular impacts, offering essential data for sustainable management strategies.",

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The substantial increase in fungal diseases, the limited availability of antifungal drugs, and rising resistance to existing treatments highlight the urgent need for developing novel antifungal drugs. Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4\u201316 \u03bcg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades. We identified a novel polyene macrolide from Kitasatospora melanogena with potent activity against major fungal pathogens. This compound disrupts both the fungal cell wall and membrane while inducing oxidative stress, revealing a multifaceted mechanism of action. Our findings highlight soil microbes as valuable reservoirs for a",

    "source": "acs: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "This study investigated how doping-modified copper sulfide (CuS) micronanoparticles (MNPs) influence tomato resistance against fungal pathogens. Three cuboidal CuS MNPs\u2500undoped (CuS), iron-doped (Fe-CuS), and cerium-doped (Ce-CuS)\u2500were foliarly applied to Fusarium-infected plants in a greenhouse study. Fe-CuS led to the highest Cu accumulation in leaves\u250015.7 and 158.4% higher than undoped CuS and Ce-CuS, respectively, likely due to its positive charge facilitating stronger electrostatic interactions and more efficient NPs uptake. Compared to the untreated control, the Fe-CuS foliar application resulted in a 487.7% increase in shoot biomass and a 36.8% reduction in wilt damage through activation of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling, indicating a dual role of CuS MNPs as both a micronutrient carrier and an immune stimulant. Importantly, copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) activation may link Cu homeostasis to stress-induced H2O2 production, indicating a novel mechanism for nanoparticle-enabled plant immunity. These findings underscore the significant potential for CuS MNPs as an alternative to conventional copper-based fungicides, though long-term environmental behavior and life cycle impacts warrant further evaluation.",

    "title": "A combined genetic and chemical approach for identifying novel antifungal compounds against Fusarium graminearum",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD\u2086\u2080\u2080 changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. IMPORTANCE This study provides a perspective on developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens with implications for agriculture and food security. The effectiveness of current fungicides is increasingly limited by resistance, narrow target ranges, and environmental concerns. By combining genetic approaches with chemical screening, this work offers a more systematic way to identify candidate antifungal agents and better understand their possible mechanisms. The framework may also be adapted for use in other areas, including medical and veterinary applications, suggesting potential broader applicability. In addition, the emphasis on exploring new molecular scaffolds supports efforts to develop more sustainable and long-term disease management strategies. Overall, this st",

    "source": "acs: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Lipin, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, a key step in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, and acts as a transcriptional coregulator of lipid metabolism. In this study, the Lipin-encoding gene (McLipin) was overexpressed in Mucor circinelloides WJ11 to evaluate its impact on lipid accumulation under submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF). Under SSF, McLipin overexpression increased cell dry weight by 19% in spores and 36.9% in mycelia compared to the control strain. Total fatty acid (TFA) content increased by 35.7% in mycelia, while in spores it increased from 10% to 18% of dry cell weight, indicating a substantial enhancement in lipid yield. Fatty acid profiling showed elevated proportions of C16:0, C18:2, and C18:3 and a reduced C18:1 content. RT-qPCR indicated that McLipin expression peaked at 24 h under SSF, coinciding with upregulation of ACC, FAS, cME, and NADPH-generating genes. These results suggest that McLipin overexpression reprograms lipid metabolism, significantly enhancing TAG biosynthesis under SSF for potential industrial lipid production.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the \u03b2-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species. In contrast, the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against A. tanneri, A. calidoustus, and A. sydowii. This study presents one of the largest species-level data sets of Aspergillus isolates to date, und",

We analyzed 140 clinical isolates from two major hospitals using HPLC and LC-MS/MS to assess gliotoxin production. Gliotoxin was detected only in Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, with no production observed in any other species under multiple culture conditions. Molecular networking and comparative genomics revealed distinct ETP-related pathways in non-A. fumigatus species, including aspirochlorine derivatives in Aspergillus flavus and aranotin-related metabolites in Aspergillus terreus. These findings clarify species-specific ETP profiles and confirm A. fumigatus as the sole gliotoxin producer among the isolates examined.",

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% \u00b1 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% \u00b1 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% \u00b1 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1\u20132) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% \u00b1 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3\u20135 (F1 92.1% \u00b1 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for laboratories lacking specialized mycology expertise, especially in resource-limited settings.

    "title": "GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide homeostasis and involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus. Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus. This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy for ",
