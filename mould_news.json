    "excerpt": "The widespread use of polypropylene-based surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated environmental plastic pollution, necessitating sustainable degradation strategies. This study investigates the biodegradation potential of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii on nonwoven polypropylene mask layers under both nutrient-rich (MSM broth) and soil microcosm conditions. A multidisciplinary approach combining weight loss measurements, FTIR-ATR spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize physical, chemical, and biochemical changes in the polymer matrix. Results show that A. bridgerii induced significant degradation in both environments, with the highest weight loss % observed in MSM microcosms (20.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u202f%), indicating active fragmentation and partial mineralization. In soil microcosms, fungal inoculation led to the most advanced oxidation (SAUB CI up to \u223c4.6), extensive surface fragmentation, and the release of unique volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including DEHP (\u223c15\u202f% GC-MS area) and long-chain ketones. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by the lowest residual mask mass (9.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u202f%), suggesting enhanced mineralization in the nutrient-limited soil. SEM analysis further confirmed pronounced fiber degradation and biofilm formation. These findings underscore the role of fungal metabolism and environmental context in modulating polypropylene decay, supporting a multiple mechanistic process such as oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation. The integration of FTIR, SEM, and GC-MS provided robust evidence of mask polymer degradation and highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii as a bioremediation agent for PPE waste.",

    "excerpt": "Aflatoxins are highly toxic secondary metabolites widely found in peanut and maize kernels. This study proposes a strategy based on self-supervised learning (SSL) for the accurate detection of Aflatoxin B1 in peanuts and maize. Firstly, an SSL backbone network was constructed to perform a spectral reconstruction task on masked spectra, providing pre-trained weights for subsequent supervised learning. Secondly, the spectral reconstruction error was innovatively used as a wavelength attention mechanism, integrated with the fine-tuned encoder from the SSL stage to develop a classification model. This model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9805\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0019 in peanuts and 0.9478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0060 in maize, outperforming other deep learning models. Furthermore, key wavelengths were selected based on the spectral reconstruction error. Experimental results demonstrated that the 40 selected key wavelengths outperformed other methods, with a more uniform distribution, capturing richer spectral features. The strategy in this study provides an efficient solution for few-sample spectral detection.",

Several methods have been conventionally employed for mycotoxin decontamination but their efficiency remained low and insufficient due to robustness of mycotoxin structures. In this article, use of unconventional technologies like irradiation, ozonation, cold activated plasma, magnetic nanoparticles, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, pulsed light, natural essential oils and phytochemicals in controlling growth of toxigenic fungi and degrading mycotoxins in various foodstuffs have been reviewed. The efficacy of decontamination of different types of major mycotoxins by these novel techniques and the associated safety and limitation factors have been analysed and discussed in detail. Combination of different unconventional techniques and impact of techno-economic-environmental aspects associated with these advanced technologies on their adoption and implementation at large scale to achieve a green and sustainable control of mycotoxins have been highlighted.",

    "excerpt": "Food contamination with mycotoxins poses a serious threat to human and animal health. Traditional chromatographic methods and rapid detection techniques are widely used for accurate quantification and on-site rapid screening, respectively, and play essential roles in food safety monitoring. However, these approaches still face limitations arising from cumbersome sample pretreatment and matrix effects. Affinity magnetic beads (AMBs), which integrate highly specific recognition elements with magnetic carriers, represent a promising solution owing to their strong enrichment capability, good dispersibility, soften matrix effects, and high compatibility with automated systems. This review discusses the structure, working principles, and applications of AMBs employing antibodies, aptamers, and molecularly imprinted polymers as recognition elements. It also evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of both chromatographic and rapid detection methods. Finally, the review highlights current challenges and future perspectives for the application of AMBs in mycotoxin detection.",

In this study, a natural and eco-friendly strategy was developed using Ligusticum jeholense essential oil (LEO), extracted via optimized enzymatic-deep eutectic solvent microwave-assisted method (EDP-MAHD), which achieved a 3.38-fold higher yield than conventional extraction. GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC\u2085\u2080, 0.0718 \u03bcL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with \u226515% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Aspergillus , Mucorales, and Fusarium ) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria \u22651 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%).

    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), a potent mycotoxin frequently detected in improperly stored poultry feed, induces hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa , exhibits strong antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory activities; however, its efficacy and mechanisms in mitigating AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity in broilers remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary CUR supplementation on growth performance and liver health of broilers exposed to AFB 1 . RESULTS A total of 720 broilers (eight replicates of 15 birds each per treatment) were fed a basal diet, an AFB\u2081\u2010contaminated diet (1 mg kg \u22121 ), or AFB 1 diets supplemented with CUR (100, 300, or 500 mg kg \u22121 ) for 42 days. AFB 1 exposure significantly reduced average daily gain and increased feed conversion ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas CUR supplementation \u2013 particularly 300\u2013500 mg kg \u22121 \u2013 improved growth performance relative to the AFB 1 group ( P &lt; 0.05). CUR also decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, alleviated hepatic histopathological damage, enhanced hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), and suppressed malondialdehyde accumulation ( P &lt; 0.01). At the molecular level, CUR upregulated Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes while downregulating NOD\u2010like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase\u20101, and interleukin\u20101\u03b2, indicating attenuation of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Dietary curcumin effectively mitigated AFB 1 \u2010induced hepatotoxicity and performance loss in broilers through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings highlight CUR as a promising natural feed additive for protecting poultry against mycotoxin\u2010induced oxidative and inflammatory damage. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Cyclobutrifluram exhibits antifungal activity against <i>Fusarium</i> spp., yet its bioactivity and resistance risk against <i>F. solani</i> remain unclear. In this study, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of cyclobutrifluram against 155 <i>F. solani</i> strains ranged from 0.0279 to 0.1102 \u03bcg/mL, with a mean of 0.0513 \u00b1 0.0170 \u03bcg/mL. Treatment with cyclobutrifluram significantly inhibited conidial production and germination, reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, increased hyphal branching, and shortened the distance between septa or cell nuclei. Cyclobutrifluram provided excellent control over PRR. Seven laboratory-generated cyclobutrifluram-resistant mutants showed no or slight fitness penalties and exhibited positive cross-resistance only with pydiflumetofen, indicating a moderate-to-high resistance risk. Resistance to cyclobutrifluram in <i>F. solani</i> was conferred by four SDH substitutions (<i>FsSdhB</i><sup>H248Y</sup>, <i>FsSdhC1</i><sup>A83V</sup>, <i>FsSdhC2</i><sup>A85V</sup>, and <i>FsSdhD</i><sup>D184G</sup>), which was confirmed by molecular docking and gene replacement.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The substantial increase in fungal diseases, the limited availability of antifungal drugs, and rising resistance to existing treatments highlight the urgent need for developing novel antifungal drugs. Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4\u201316 \u03bcg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades.

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD \u2086\u2080\u2080 changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. IMPORTANCE This study provides a perspective on developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens with implications for agriculture and food security. The effectiveness of current fungicides is increasingly limited by resistance, narrow target ranges, and environmental concerns.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non- fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the \u03b2-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species. In contrast, the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against A. tanneri , A. calidoustus , and A. sydowii . This study presents one of the largest species-level data sets of Aspergillus isolates to date,",

    "excerpt": "Gliotoxin, an epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin, has been reported in several fungal species, but its distribution remains unclear. We analyzed 140 clinical isolates from two major hospitals using HPLC and LC-MS/MS to assess gliotoxin production. Gliotoxin was detected only in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> isolates, with no production observed in any other species under multiple culture conditions. Molecular networking and comparative genomics revealed distinct ETP-related pathways in non-<i>A. fumigatus</i> species, including aspirochlorine derivatives in <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> and aranotin-related metabolites in <i>Aspergillus terreus</i>. These findings clarify species-specific ETP profiles and confirm <i>A. fumigatus</i> as the sole gliotoxin producer among the isolates examined.",

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus ), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% \u00b1 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% \u00b1 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% \u00b1 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1\u20132) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% \u00b1 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3\u20135 (F1 92.1% \u00b1 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for laboratories lacking specialized mycology expertise, especially in resource-limited settings. IMPORTANCE Timely, accurate mold identification can save lives, yet today it often requires days of growth and scarce expert time. MoldVision offers a practical altern",

    "title": "GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide homeostasis and involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus . Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus ; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus . This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy",
