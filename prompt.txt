            "ANALYTICAL LENS (Patchy Anthropocene):\n"
            "The Patchy Anthropocene lens brings 'located relations between humans and nonhumans into focus within "
            "the broader ongoing material transformations and ruptures brought on by colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism' "
            "(Tsing, Deger, Saxemna, and Zhou 2024, Field Guide to the Patchy Anthropocene). "
            "As Cross writes, (The moulds at the end of the corridor 2025), "
            "The same species of mould flagged as planetary pathogens can also be "
            "vehicles for accumulation; the same species that operate as signs of austerity or racialized exclusion can also "
            "be potential industrial saviours. The capacity of moulds to metabolize diverse materials — from food, walls and "
            "minerals to livers and lungs — and to rapidly adapt to external stresses makes them both a threat and a resource. "
            "What emerges from such ecological assemblages in turbulent times are not just novel strains of mould but also "
            "novel forms of social and economic power.\n\n"

            "STRUCTURE: Write 5 to 7 sentences.\n"
            "- Paragraph 1 (first 3-5 sentences): The first sentences accurately summarise the source findings. Report only what the source text contains. "
            "Use specific data, methods, organisms, and materials named in the source.\n"
            "- Paragraph 2 (final 2-3 sentences): The final 2-3 sentences frame the findings through the Patchy Anthropocene lens described above."
            "- Insert a blank line between paragraph 1 and paragraph 2."
            "Draw out the tension, duality, or material entanglement implied by the research — "
            "for example, how a pathogen is also a resource, how a remediation technology reveals deeper dependencies, "
            "or how a clinical finding reflects broader patterns of exposure shaped by housing, labour, or capital. "
            "These sentences should be observational and grounded — do not invent details not implied by the source. "
            "Do NOT reproduce the Patchy Anthropocene description verbatim. "
            "Apply the lens in your own words, specific to the findings of this paper.\n\n"
            "TONE: Clinical, detached, observational. No enthusiasm, no hedging. "
            "Write as if documenting a field site, not reviewing a paper.\n\n"
            "READABILITY: Write for an educated general audience, not specialists. "
            "Replace specialist jargon with plain language equivalents — for example, write 'programmed cell death' "
            "not 'apoptosis', 'reduced the spread of damage' not 'significantly inhibited lesion expansion', "
            "'genetic variation' not 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'cell membrane damage' not 'lipid peroxidation'. "
            "Keep the scientific detail but express it in words a non-scientist can follow.\n\n"
           
            "STRICT CONSTRAINTS:\n"
            "1. NO HALLUCINATION: Do not invent findings, organisms, locations, or materials not present in the source text. "
            "If the source lacks detail, acknowledge the limitation rather than fabricating an analysis. "
            "If RELATED RESEARCH CONTEXT is provided, it is for your background awareness ONLY. "
            "Do NOT report findings from related articles as if they belong to the source paper. "
            "Do NOT merge, blend, or attribute related findings to the source. "
            "Your factual summary sentences must describe ONLY the source abstract.\n"
            
            "2. WEAK SIGNAL PROTOCOL: If the source text contains only metadata (author names, journal info, publication date) "
            "with no substantive abstract or findings, output ONLY the following message and nothing else:\n"
            "\"This publication is still hot off the press. That means the paper is not yet indexed by global "
            "databases like CrossRef, Semantic Scholar or OpenAlex. If you want to learn what the research might have to say about life on Planet Mould "
            "you'll just have to read it yourself!\"\n"
            "Do not attempt a full summary from a title alone. "
            "Related research context does NOT substitute for missing source data.\n"
            
            "3. NO ACRONYMS OR ABBREVIATIONS: Write every term in full, every time. "
            "Do not introduce an acronym even once. For example: write 'polymerase chain reaction' not 'PCR', "
            "'minimum inhibitory concentration' not 'MIC', 'reactive oxygen species' not 'ROS', "
            "'single nucleotide polymorphism' not 'SNP'. This applies to ALL technical terms throughout the entire summary.\n"
            
            "4. DIRECT REFERENCE: Always refer to the source directly as 'this paper', 'this study', or 'this report'. "
            "Never use indefinite references like 'a paper', 'a study', or 'research has shown'.\n"
            
            "5. MATERIAL SPECIFICITY: Do not use vague terms like 'infrastructure' or 'environment' in isolation. "
            "Name the specific material, organism, or site described in the source (e.g. 'polypropylene mask fabric', 'postharvest tomato storage').\n"
            
            "6. DO NOT use the first person ('I', 'me', 'my'). DO NOT describe your role. "
            "DO NOT give a Title or Abstract heading for your summary.\n"
            
            "7. DO NOT repeat the title of the article in your summary."
