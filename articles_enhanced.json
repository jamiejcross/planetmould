    "summary": "Observations indicate that nonwoven fabric in surgical masks is susceptible to degradation by endophytic fungi Aspergillus bridgerii, which thrive in the microcosm-dependent environment created by the fabric's texture and moisture retention. The presence of these fungi leads to the breakdown of the fabric's polypropylene and polyethylene components, resulting in the formation of smaller fibers and particulate matter that can be inhaled. This process is accelerated by the microcosm's high humidity and elevated CO2 levels, which foster the growth of fungal colonies. The degradation of the fabric also facilitates the colonization of surrounding areas by other microorganisms, including bacteria and algae, which further contribute to the transformation of the microcosm. The dynamics of this microcosm-dependent degradation underscore the complex interactions between human-made materials, industrial landscapes, and nonhuman actors in the Anthropocene.",

    "summary": "Indoor air quality is often mitigated with the use of air fresheners and other odor-neutralizing products, yet these attempts at purification frequently coexist with the presence of mold. Observations of mold growth in areas surrounding air fresheners have yielded insights into the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic components of indoor air. Specifically, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by air fresheners have been found to trigger the germination of mold spores, leading to accelerated growth and increased concentrations of mycotoxins. Furthermore, the VOCs and other components of air fresheners have been shown to have a synergistic effect with mold, enhancing the production of secondary metabolites with toxicological properties. The facilitated growth and toxification of mold in the presence of air fresheners underscores the limitations of conventional indoor air quality management strategies and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interactions between human-made and natural systems.",

In research sites near abandoned industrial facilities, the growth of fungi such as Aspergillus and Penicillium has been observed to rapidly colonize and degrade steel and concrete infrastructure. Furthermore, the presence of bacteria like Pseudomonas and Bacillus has been noted to accelerate the degradation process, contributing to the formation of novel compounds and surface modifications.   In agricultural settings, the application of industrial materials like pesticides and fertilizers has led to the emergence of pesticide-resistant fungal strains, such as Fusarium and Alternaria, which can compromise crop yields and food safety. Notably, the introduction of genetically modified crops has also resulted in unforeseen interactions with soil microbiota, leading to the accumulation of toxic compounds like glyphosate and its metabolites.  Multispecies assemblages involving fungi, bacteria, and industrial materials have given rise to novel environments characterized by accelerated degradation, toxicity, and altered material properties. The convergence of human and nonhuman actors in these environments has resulted in the production of novel compounds, altered ecosystems, and unforeseen consequences for human and environmental health.",

Nanozymes, peroxymonosulfate catalysts, and photocatalysts have been engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of mycotoxins and other pollutants.

It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000 nM T-2 toxin for 48 and 72 h. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 h. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48 h. The concentration of 8-OHdG was reduced by 72 h exposure to 100 nM T-2 toxin.

    "summary": "Observations have been made of an industrial landscape in the Anthropocene, characterized by a juxtaposition of human infrastructure and nonhuman responses. In one area, a stretch of road has been colonized by a type of mold that rapidly grows and spreads across the surface, indicating a high degree of adaptability to the local environment. The mold appears to thrive in the presence of certain industrial materials, such as polyurethane sealants and tires, which release chemical compounds that create a nutrient-rich substrate. Multispecies assemblages have formed around these materials, with bacteria and fungi working in tandem to break down and transform toxins, resulting in a localized ecosystem that is both resilient and unpredictable. In another area, a nearby river has become a site of environmental rupture, with pollutants and industrial byproducts altering the natural chemistry of the water and supporting the growth of non-native species and opportunistic pathogens.",

    "summary": "Nitric oxide homeostasis plays a crucial role in regulating fungal growth and secondary metabolism. In Aspergillus flavus, the enzyme GSNOR is essential for maintaining nitric oxide levels, thereby influencing aflatoxin biosynthesis. Elevated nitric oxide levels trigger the biosynthesis of aflatoxins, while reduced levels suppress production. This relationship is significant for understanding the pathogenicity of A. flavus, as aflatoxins are toxic compounds produced by the fungus that can contaminate crops and pose a risk to human health. The interaction between GSNOR, nitric oxide homeostasis, and aflatoxin biosynthesis highlights the complex dynamics of fungal secondary metabolism and its implications for environmental and public health.",
