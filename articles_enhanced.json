    "summary": "This paper reports on the degradation of nonwoven fabric in surgical masks by the plant-internal microbe fungus Aspergillus bridgerii. The study used a microcosm setup, which simulates a controlled environment, to investigate the degradation process.  Aspergillus bridgerii caused significant degradation of the fabric in the microcosm, but the extent of degradation varied depending on the presence of certain nutrients. The study highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii to break down nonwoven fabric, which could have implications for the durability and effectiveness of surgical masks.   The findings of this study suggest that the same organism that can pose a threat to human health can also be a catalyst for material breakdown. This duality underscores the complex relationships between microorganisms, materials, and environments in the Anthropocene, where the boundaries between health and degradation, and between resource and pathogen, become increasingly blurred.",

GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC₅₀, 0.0718 μL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000 nM T-2 toxin for 48 and 72 h. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 h. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48 h. The concentration of 8-OHdG was reduced by 72 h exposure to 100 nM T-2 toxin. In the case of IL-6, the 1,000 nM T-2 toxin was able to decrease its levels after 48 and 72 h, whereas IL-8 levels were lowered after 72 h by all three toxin treatments. Overall, these resu",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the effects of T-2 toxin on three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. The researchers treated the cultures with varying concentrations of T-2 toxin (100, 500, and 1,000 nM) for 48 and 72 hours. They measured the metabolic activity of the cells, oxidative homeostasis, and immune response using assays such as the CCK-8 assay, and by quantifying the levels of MDA, HSP27, 8-OHdG, IL-6, and IL-8. The results show that T-2 toxin decreased the metabolic activity of the cells, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 hours. The toxin also significantly diminished the levels of MDA and HSP27 after 48 hours, and reduced the concentration of 8-OHdG after 72 hours exposure to 100 nM T-2 toxin. Additionally, the toxin lowered the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 after 48 and 72 hours, respectively. These findings suggest that T-2 toxin can induce oxidative stress and disrupt immune function in chicken liver cells.  The T-2 toxin's capacity to damage liver cells in chicken cultures highlights the complex material entanglement between this fungal toxin and the poultry industry. On one hand, T-2 toxin is a potent threat to the health of chickens, capable of inducing oxidative stress and disrupting immune function. On the other hand, the toxin's presence in poultry feed can also reveal deeper dependencies between the industry, fungal pathogens, and the broader ecological context in which they operate.",

However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) (P < 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus, and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of specific genetic mutations on the resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus to azole medications. The researchers analyzed 34 different variants of the cyp51A gene and identified four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms): L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S. They also examined the effects of combinations of these mutations, including TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S. Using a three-dimensional protein model and the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique, the researchers introduced these mutations into a wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus strain and tested its susceptibility to four azoles: itraconazole, voriconazole, isavuconazole, and posaconazole. The results showed that the mutated strains had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations for all four azoles, with particularly high minimum inhibitory concentrations for itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. The combination mutation TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S exhibited a observable trait profile consistent with clinical strains that are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. The study's findings suggest a correlation between molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene and the structure-function relationship of the laboratory-based observable trait profile.   The molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene reveal a complex interplay between genetic variation and drug susceptibility in Aspergillus fumigatus.

Three cuboidal CuS MNPs─undoped (CuS), iron-doped (Fe-CuS), and cerium-doped (Ce-CuS)─were foliarly applied to Fusarium-infected plants in a greenhouse study. Fe-CuS led to the highest Cu accumulation in leaves─15.7 and 158.4% higher than undoped CuS and Ce-CuS, respectively, likely due to its positive charge facilitating stronger electrostatic interactions and more efficient NPs uptake. Compared to the untreated control, the Fe-CuS foliar application resulted in a 487.7% increase in shoot biomass and a 36.8% reduction in wilt damage through activation of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling, indicating a dual role of CuS MNPs as both a micronutrient carrier and an immune stimulant. Importantly, copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) activation may link Cu homeostasis to stress-induced H2O2 production, indicating a novel mechanism for nanoparticle-enabled plant immunity.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites.

    "summary": "This paper established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. The platform involved deleting genes encoding known fungicide targets, resulting in altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides in the mutants compared with the wild-type strain. By examining a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules, the researchers identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway, several of which exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity. These compounds have potential as novel scaffolds for future development. The platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, applicable to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. This study may contribute to developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens, particularly in agriculture and food security, where the effectiveness of current fungicides is increasingly limited by resistance and other concerns.",

    "excerpt": "Lipin, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, a key step in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, and acts as a transcriptional coregulator of lipid metabolism. In this study, the Lipin-encoding gene (McLipin) was overexpressed in Mucor circinelloides WJ11 to evaluate its impact on lipid accumulation under submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF). Under SSF, McLipin overexpression increased cell dry weight by 19% in spores and 36.9% in mycelia compared to the control strain. Total fatty acid (TFA) content increased by 35.7% in mycelia, while in spores it increased from 10% to 18% of dry cell weight, indicating a substantial enhancement in lipid yield. Fatty acid profiling showed elevated proportions of C16:0, C18:2, and C18:3 and a reduced C18:1 content. RT-qPCR indicated that McLipin expression peaked at 24 h under SSF, coinciding with upregulation of ACC, FAS, cME, and NADPH-generating genes. These results suggest that McLipin overexpression reprograms lipid metabolism, significantly enhancing TAG biosynthesis under SSF for potential industrial lipid production.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the β-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species. In contrast, the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against A. tanneri, A. calidoustus, and A. sydowii.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% ± 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1–2) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% ± 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3–5 (F1 92.1% ± 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately.

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus. Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus. This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy for ",

The research highlights the complex interactions between NO, reactive oxygen species, and fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus flavus.  The tension between S-nitrosoglutathione reductase's role in maintaining nitric oxide homeostasis and its involvement in aflatoxin biosynthesis reflects the duality of this enzyme in fungal metabolism. As a regulator of nitric oxide signaling, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase is essential for fungal development and pathogenicity, but its activity also contributes to the production of carcinogenic aflatoxins.
