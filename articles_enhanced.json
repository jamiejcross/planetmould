    "summary": "In the Anthropocene, multispecies assemblages interact with industrial materials in unpredictable ways. Aspergillus bridgerii, an endophytic fungus, has been observed to degrade nonwoven fabric in surgical masks, which are designed to filter out airborne pathogens. This degradation is facilitated by the fungus's ability to break down polypropylene, a common material used in mask production. The breakdown of masks can lead to the release of microplastics and other pollutants into the environment, further exacerbating ecosystem disruption. The degradation of masks by Aspergillus bridgerii highlights the complex, often unanticipated interactions between human infrastructure and nonhuman life forms in the Anthropocene.",

These SNPs, such as those located at positions 54 and 98, have been found to alter the azole-binding site within the cyp51A enzyme, thereby reducing the effectiveness of these antifungal compounds. The combination of these SNPs, as well as other factors, can result in the altered azole phenotype observed in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, rendering treatment regimens less effective in certain populations of A. fumigatus.
