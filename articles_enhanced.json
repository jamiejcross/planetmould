    "excerpt": "While traditionally the health impacts of the biotic and abiotic components of indoor air have been assumed to be independent, recent studies indicate the opposite, highlighting the need for a systematic evaluation of their interactions to provide a holistic assessment of the health impacts of indoor air. In this study, we assessed the toxicological relationship between a commonly found indoor mold species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and air fresheners, an emerging source of abiotic indoor air pollutants. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of mold and two air fresheners (Brands A and B) on A549 cells and then tested the effect of co-exposure to the two toxicants on various cellular responses. We also analyzed the chemical composition of the air fresheners using LC-MS. Our results show that both air fresheners were composed of several compounds that could inhibit mold growth and pose health risks to humans. Furthermore, the chemical composition and concentration of the air freshener solutions could influence the toxicological interactions. Overall, our study demonstrates the need for further research on these interactions for a comprehensive assessment of indoor air health impacts. The knowledge will also allow air freshener manufacturers to formulate products with minimal health impacts.",

The ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method allowed for the detection of mycotoxins at concentrations as low as 0.5 micrograms per kilogram, while the Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy method enabled rapid detection and identification of the mycotoxins in a matter of seconds. The researchers also assessed the risk associated with consuming mycotoxin-contaminated edible herbs, finding that the levels of mycotoxins detected were within acceptable limits for human consumption.   the importance of monitoring mycotoxin levels in edible herbs and the potential for rapid detection using Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in quantifying mycotoxin levels in these herbs, and the risk assessment results suggest that the levels of mycotoxins detected are generally safe for human consumption. However, the study also underscores the need for continued monitoring and regulation of mycotoxin levels in edible herbs to ensure consumer safety.

The results showed that alternariol caused a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and induced programmed cell death in colon cancer cells under both normal and high glucose conditions. In contrast, deoxynivalenol reduced the spread of damage caused by alternariol under normal glucose conditions but had the opposite effect under high glucose conditions, where it enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species and cell membrane damage. The findings suggest that hyperglycemic conditions can modulate the cell-damaging effects of mycotoxins on colon cancer cells, with implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.  This research highlights the complex interplay between environmental stressors, such as hyperglycemia, and the response of cancer cells to toxins like alternariol and deoxynivalenol. The same mycotoxins can have opposing effects on cancer cells under different glucose conditions, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of the material entanglements between human, environmental, and cellular systems.",

GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC₅₀, 0.0718 μL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms.

The researchers developed a new extraction method, optimized enzymatic-deep eutectic solvent microwave-assisted method, which yielded a higher quantity of LEO than conventional extraction methods. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the consistent chemical composition of LEO across different production batches. In laboratory experiments, LEO showed potent antifungal activity against A. alternata, with an inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC₅₀) of 0.0718 microliters per milliliter. In experiments on tomato fruit, LEO substantially reduced the spread of damage caused by A. alternata and suppressed the accumulation of two mycotoxins: alternariol and tenuazonic acid (TeA). Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, protein-level analysis, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted the cell membrane, interfered with energy production, and induced oxidative stress in the fungus, suggesting that LEO acts through multiple mechanisms to control fungal growth. Toxicity tests in mice confirmed that LEO is safe for use. These findings suggest that LEO could be a promising natural preservative for controlling postharvest diseases and mycotoxin accumulation in tomatoes.  The Patchy Anthropocene lens highlights the complex relationships between humans, nonhumans, and the environment in this study. On one hand, LEO is a natural substance that can be used to control a fungal pathogen threatening food safety and shelf life.

    "excerpt": "T-2 toxin is a secondary metabolite produced by different Fusarium species that causes serious problems in the poultry industry. It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000 nM T-2 toxin for 48 and 72 h. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 h. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48 h. The concentration of 8-OHdG was reduced by 72 h exposure to 100 nM T-2 toxin.

    "summary": "The study investigated the effects of T-2 toxin, a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium species, on three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. The cultures were treated with three different concentrations of T-2 toxin (100, 500, and 1,000 nM) for two time periods (48 and 72 hours).  T-2 toxin reduced the metabolic activity of the cells, but this reduction was alleviated after 72 hours. The toxin also caused significant changes in the levels of oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde and heat shock protein 27, which were diminished after 48 hours. Additionally, the concentration of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress, was reduced after 72 hours exposure to the lowest concentration of T-2 toxin (100 nM). The study also found that T-2 toxin decreased the levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, which are indicators of immune response, after 48 and 72 hours of exposure.   The capacity of T-2 toxin to induce oxidative stress and modulate immune function in chicken liver cells highlights its potential as a pathogen, causing harm to poultry and the poultry industry.

However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) (P < 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus, and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole.

The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains were higher than those of the wild type, with significant elevations in itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole minimum inhibitory concentrations.  the genetic profile TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S showed a consistent observable traits to clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole.

Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4–16 μg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades.

    "summary": "This study identified a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1, isolated from the soil microbe Kitasatospora melanogena. The compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 4 to 16 micrograms per milliliter. When exposed to compound 1, Aspergillus fumigatus experienced significant growth reduction and disruption of its cell wall and membrane. A gene-expression analysis analysis revealed that compound 1 decreased activity of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species.

    "excerpt": "This study investigated how doping-modified copper sulfide (CuS) micronanoparticles (MNPs) influence tomato resistance against fungal pathogens. Three cuboidal CuS MNPs─undoped (CuS), iron-doped (Fe-CuS), and cerium-doped (Ce-CuS)─were foliarly applied to Fusarium-infected plants in a greenhouse study. Fe-CuS led to the highest Cu accumulation in leaves─15.7 and 158.4% higher than undoped CuS and Ce-CuS, respectively, likely due to its positive charge facilitating stronger electrostatic interactions and more efficient NPs uptake. Compared to the untreated control, the Fe-CuS foliar application resulted in a 487.7% increase in shoot biomass and a 36.8% reduction in wilt damage through activation of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling, indicating a dual role of CuS MNPs as both a micronutrient carrier and an immune stimulant. Importantly, copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) activation may link Cu homeostasis to stress-induced H2O2 production, indicating a novel mechanism for nanoparticle-enabled plant immunity. These findings underscore the significant potential for CuS MNPs as an alternative to conventional copper-based fungicides, though long-term environmental behavior and life cycle impacts warrant further evaluation.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. IMPORTANCE This study provides a perspective on developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens with implications for agriculture and food security.

Fatty acid profiling showed elevated proportions of C16:0, C18:2, and C18:3 and a reduced C18:1 content. RT-qPCR indicated that McLipin expression peaked at 24 h under SSF, coinciding with upregulation of ACC, FAS, cME, and NADPH-generating genes.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the β-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency.

We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus. Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus. This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis.
