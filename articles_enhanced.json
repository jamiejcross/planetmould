    "summary": "This paper reports on a multicenter study that aimed to develop a diagnostic tool for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients. The study retrospectively analyzed data from 238 patients at three tertiary hospitals, classifying them as either having IPA or non-IPA based on consensus definitions. The researchers used targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to quantify Aspergillus fungal load and combined this with clinical, radiological, and microbiological variables. A multivariable logistic regression model was built and internally validated via bootstrapping to assess diagnostic performance. The results showed that patients with IPA had higher rates of diabetes (73.9%) and corticosteroid use compared to non-IPA cases. The study found that a diagnostic nomogram combining Aspergillus load with host risk factors could accurately diagnose IPA in non-neutropenic patients.  The findings of this study highlight the challenge of diagnosing IPA in non-neutropenic patients, where non-specific manifestations and limited diagnostic tools make it difficult to identify the condition. The use of tNGS to quantify Aspergillus load in BALF provides a potential tool for diagnosis, but its capacity for quantitative assessment remains unclear. The study demonstrates that integrating Aspergillus load with host risk factors, such as diabetes and corticosteroid use, can improve diagnostic accuracy. The results of this study suggest that a diagnostic nomogram could be a useful tool for clinicians to diagnose IPA in non-neutropenic patients.  The entanglement of Aspergillus as a pathogen and a resource is evident in the context of this study. While Aspergillus is a significant threat to human health, particularly in immune-weakened individuals, it can also be a resource for developing diagnostic tools and treatments. The study's focus on developing a diagnostic tool for IPA highlights the complex relationship between humans and nonhumans, where the same species can pose both risks and opportunities.",

The microcosm used in this study was specifically designed to mimic the conditions found in the human body, allowing for the examination of the fungus's ability to degrade the fabric in a controlled setting. The research suggests that Aspergillus bridgerii can exploit the fabric's material properties, using its enzymatic capabilities to break down the polymer chains and cause degradation. This finding has implications for the development of new materials and technologies for surgical masks, as well as for understanding the interactions between fungi and synthetic materials in various environments.

This report highlights the effective management of a severe skin injury caused by amphotericin B colloidal dispersion extravasation in an immune-weakened patient. The case demonstrates the importance of prompt intervention and the use of specific nursing interventions to mitigate the damage. The patient's skin damage, caused by the interaction of a pharmaceutical material (amphotericin B colloidal dispersion) and a compromised host (immune-weakened patient), underscores the complex and entangled nature of human-nonhuman relations in clinical settings.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are common and often fatal in severe burn patients due to skin barrier loss and immune dysfunction. However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) (P < 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus, and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

The study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria for invasive mold infections in this population, including direct microscopy, culture, species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489 out of 6,184 samples were positive, with Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium being the most common mold types identified. The number of positive diagnostic criteria was associated with increased mortality, with 46.7% of patients having 5 or more positive criteria experiencing mortality.   The study found that plasma quantitative polymerase chain reaction was a reliable method for detecting Mucorales infections, particularly in cases with skin involvement. The combination of skin biopsies and species-specific plasma quantitative polymerase chain reaction enhanced timely and reliable diagnosis of invasive mold infections in burn patients. The findings underscore the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.  The study highlights the complex interplay between invasive mold infections and burn injuries, where the loss of skin barrier and immune dysfunction create an ideal environment for mold growth and infection. The diagnostic criteria evaluated in this study can be seen as a tool to navigate this complex material assemblage, where the same species that pose a threat to human health can also be vehicles for accumulation and adaptation. The reliance on multiple diagnostic criteria to guide treatment reflects the patchy and fragmented nature of the material environment in which invasive mold infections occur.",

AFB1, a common contaminant in improperly stored poultry feed, causes oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. The researchers aimed to determine if CUR, a polyphenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, could mitigate these effects. The study found that dietary CUR supplementation improved growth performance and reduced liver injury in broilers exposed to AFB1. This was attributed to CUR's activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway and inhibition of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome.   The capacity of CUR to counteract the negative effects of AFB1 highlights the complex interplay between dietary components and environmental toxins in poultry health.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

The researchers identified 34 cyp51A variants among clinical isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022. They focused on four specific single nucleotide polymorphisms - L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S - and their combinations, including TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S. The study used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique to introduce these mutations into the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain, and then conducted laboratory-based susceptibility testing to confirm the azole observable traits observed in clinical isolates. The results showed that the mutated strains had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations of four azoles compared to the wild-type strain, with highly elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. The combination mutation TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S showed a consistent observable trait profile with clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. The study's findings suggest that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene can predict the structure-function relationship of laboratory-based observable traits.  The study highlights the complex relationship between Aspergillus fumigatus and azole resistance, where molecular adaptations can both compromise and exploit the pathogen's interaction with its environment. The identification of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms and their combinations as drivers of azole resistance underscores the need for targeted treatment strategies that account for the nuanced material entanglements between the pathogen, the drug, and the host.",

Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the β-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species. In contrast, the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against A. tanneri, A. calidoustus, and A. sydowii. This study presents one of the largest species-level data sets of Aspergillus isolates to date, und",

    "summary": "This paper analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. The isolates belonged to 38 different Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species making up 77.1% of all isolates. The most commonly recovered species were Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto, Aspergillus sydowii, Aspergillus calidoustus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus tanneri, and Aspergillus terreus. Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using a technique called matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, while polymerase chain reaction sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates.  The study found that patients with underlying clinical conditions such as bronchiectasis, chronic granulomatous disease, and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection were more likely to be infected with Aspergillus. Eight patients died, with six of these deaths occurring in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species, while the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against certain species such as Aspergillus tanneri and Aspergillus calidoustus.  The findings of this study highlight the diversity of Aspergillus species that can cause human infections, and the need for more effective antifungal therapies, particularly against species that are resistant to standard treatments. The study's emphasis on species-level identification and antifungal susceptibility testing underscores the importance of targeted approaches to diagnosing and treating Aspergillus infections. Through its comprehensive analysis of clinical Aspergillus isolates, this study contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between humans, Aspergillus species, and the environment, revealing the duality of these organisms as both pathogens and potential resources for accumulation.",

Gliotoxin was detected only in Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, with no production observed in any other species under multiple culture conditions. Molecular networking and comparative genomics revealed distinct ETP-related pathways in non-A. fumigatus species, including aspirochlorine derivatives in Aspergillus flavus and aranotin-related metabolites in Aspergillus terreus.

The researchers analyzed 140 isolates using high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect gliotoxin production.

These findings clarify the species-specific epipolythiodioxopiperazine profiles and confirm A. fumigatus as the sole gliotoxin producer among the examined isolates.  The capacity of Aspergillus fumigatus to produce gliotoxin stands in contrast to the presence of epipolythiodioxopiperazine-related pathways in other fungal species, which fail to produce this toxin. This highlights the complex material entanglements between fungal species and their metabolic capabilities, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of the diverse relationships between microorganisms and their environments.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Mold identification in clinical diagnostics is traditionally labor-intensive and is dependent on expert interpretation. MoldVision is a deep-learning approach that uses smartphone images of mold cultures to automate identification. We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% ± 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1–2) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% ± 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3–5 (F1 92.1% ± 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for laboratories lacking specialized mycology expertise, especially in resource-limited settings.

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus. Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus. This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy for ",
