This study investigates the efficacy of Micro-Nanobubble oxygenated irrigation (MNBs) compared with conventional flooding (CF) in ameliorating saline-alkali soil and enhancing cotton growth.MethodsA field microplot experiment was conducted across four soil salinity levels (0, 3%, 6%, and 9%, with sulfate as the dominant salt).ResultsThe results demonstrated that MNBs effectively reduced topsoil (0~20 cm) salinity and mitigated its associated alkalinity stress by facilitating salt leaching into deeper soil layers (20~60 cm). This irrigation method also significantly improved soil enzyme activities and altered ionic dynamics toward a more favorable balance. Moreover, MNBs enhanced soil bacterial diversity, enriched beneficial phyla such as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and modulated fungal genera including Alternaria and Fusarium, suggesting an improved rhizospheric microbiome. In terms of cotton physiology, Micro-nanobubble oxygenation irrigation significantly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in cotton leaves by 15.",
