    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Food Chemistry",
    "excerpt": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination in edible oils poses significant health risks. Fe, N co-doped biochar (FeNBC) was synthesized from straw and integrated with sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation during oil aqueous refining. FeNBC activated sodium bisulfite to generate reactive oxygen species, degrading AFB1 that migrated into the aqueous phase. Over 98% of AFB1 (100 μg/L) was removed from oil within 50 min, with a reaction rate constant 3.02 times higher than that of pristine biochar and negligible impact on oil quality. Quenching and site-poisoning experiments identified Fe-Nx as the main catalytic site, with singlet oxygen and superoxide radical as the dominant active species. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that N-coordination modulates the Fe d-band center, facilitates charge redistribution, and promotes Fe valence cycling, thereby enhancing bisulfite adsorption and overcoming electron-transfer limitations during activation. This work provides a practical detoxification strategy and fundamental insights for designing food-compatible advanced oxidation technologies.",

    "summary": "This paper describes the synthesis of iron and nitrogen co-doped biochar from straw and its application as a catalyst in the degradation of aflatoxin B1 during edible oil refining. The biochar activated sodium bisulfite to produce reactive oxygen species that broke down aflatoxin B1 migrating into the aqueous phase of the refining process, removing over 98% of the toxin (at 100 micrograms per litre) within 50 minutes. The reaction proceeded 3.02 times faster than with untreated biochar, while leaving oil quality unaffected. Experiments isolating specific catalytic sites and reactive species identified iron-nitrogen coordination complexes as the primary active sites, with singlet oxygen and superoxide radical as the dominant degradation agents. Electrochemical measurements and computational modelling showed that nitrogen coordination altered the electronic structure of iron atoms, redistributed charge, enabled cycling between iron valence states, and enhanced both the binding of bisulfite and electron transfer during the activation process.  The research embeds a food safety intervention within material transformations that reveal deeper dependencies in commodity processing. The same straw-derived biochar that serves as a detoxification technology also demonstrates how agricultural residues can be repositioned as industrial catalysts—a shift that depends on precise control of elemental composition and surface chemistry. The capacity to degrade a mycotoxin while preserving oil quality illustrates the narrow technical margins within which food safety operates under industrial pressure, and the reliance on engineered materials to manage contamination that arises from prior ecological or storage failures.",

    "source": "Frontiers in Immunology | New and Recent Articles",
    "excerpt": "Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and a major contribution to tumor progression and resistance to therapies arise from tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor is indeed able to shape a self-permissive TME, reprogramming the cellular components into allies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), abundant in BC TME, mainly acquire an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype able to fuel tumor progression, immune evasion, metastasis and therapy resistance through a dynamic crosstalk with cancer cells. MicroRNAs, transferred via extracellular vesicles and exploited by the tumor to mold an immunesuppressive niche, act as central mediators of this bidirectional communication: tumor-derived miRNAs can reprogram macrophages toward an M2-like functional program, and TAM-derived miRNAs in turn promote and sustain cancer cell progression. This miRNA-orchestrated plasticity highlights TAMs as key TME regulators. Clinically, miRNA modulation offers promising strategies for TAM reprogramming, alongside their utility as prognostic biomarkers. Integrating miRNA-targeted TME interventions with conventional therapies holds the potential to overcome resistance in high-TAM B",

    "summary": "This paper examines how microRNAs function as molecular signals that reprogram immune cells within breast cancer tumors. The study describes tumor-associated macrophages—immune cells that accumulate in breast cancer tissue—as primarily adopting an immunosuppressive form that promotes tumor growth, immune evasion, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. The paper identifies microRNAs, which are transferred between cells via extracellular vesicles (small membrane-bound packages), as central mediators of communication between cancer cells and macrophages. Tumor-derived microRNAs reprogram macrophages toward an immunosuppressive functional state, while macrophage-derived microRNAs in turn sustain cancer cell progression, creating a bidirectional exchange. This study proposes that modulating microRNAs offers clinical potential both for redirecting macrophage behavior and as prognostic markers to predict patient outcomes.  Within the patchy landscape of breast cancer, this paper documents how a single molecular mechanism—microRNA transfer—simultaneously enables tumor survival and creates a point of intervention. The immunosuppressive macrophages that accumulate in high numbers within tumors are not fixed cellular states but rather plastic entities continuously reshaped through molecular crosstalk; the same signaling system that allows tumors to construct a permissive niche could theoretically be disrupted to dismantle it. This dual capacity—microRNAs as both instruments of tumor control and potential therapeutic targets—reveals how the material entanglement of cancer cells and immune cells produces both deepening dependency and latent vulnerability.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Environmental Pollution",
    "excerpt": "Fungal spores, a common component of biological air pollution, may negatively affect human health by triggering allergic symptoms. To assess the risk of exposure to allergens, abundant and highly allergenic Alternaria spp. and Cladosporium spp. spore concentrations are routinely measured, but almost exclusively on rooftops. In contrast, research on concentrations at ground-level, where people spend most of their time outdoors, is scarce. Although there is evidence that the main source of fungal spores is agricultural areas during harvest, it remains unclear how the proximity of crops influences ground-level spore concentrations. To address this, portable volumetric traps and meteorological stations were used to conduct three ground-level measurement campaigns (before, during, and after harvesting) throughout the main sporulation season in 2023. Nine sampling points in Poznań (Poland) represented the main land use types: agricultural, urban, and forest. The maximum concentrations were 1,369 spores/m<sup>3</sup> (Alternaria, 47% higher than the rooftop maximum) and 88,820 spores/m<sup>3</sup> (Cladosporium, 458% higher), both recorded in agricultural areas. On average, concentrations of Cladosporium spores increased during harvest, whereas Alternaria concentrations substantially increased after harvest. The highest concentrations of Alternaria and Cladosporium spores were associated with air influxes from arable land (rho = 0.20 and 0.35, respectively) and grasslands (only Cladosporium, rho = 0.24). Overall, we successfully established an extensive, mobile, ground-level spore measurement network, which revealed differences in fungal spore concentrations across land-use types, harvest activities, and in comparison with regional-level measurements. This study represents an important step toward assessing airborne fungal spore concentrations relevant to human exposure.",

    "summary": "Fungal spores from Alternaria and Cladosporium species were measured at ground level across nine sampling locations in Poznań, Poland, representing agricultural, urban, and forest land types during three campaigns timed to before, during, and after the 2023 harvest season. Ground-level concentrations substantially exceeded those typically recorded on rooftops: Alternaria reached 1,369 spores per cubic metre (47 percent higher than rooftop measurements) and Cladosporium reached 88,820 spores per cubic metre (458 percent higher), with both maxima occurring in agricultural areas. Cladosporium spore concentrations increased during harvest, while Alternaria concentrations rose substantially after harvest. Air masses originating from arable land showed the strongest association with elevated spore levels for both species, while grasslands correlated specifically with Cladosporium elevation.  The findings expose a material geography of exposure shaped by harvesting labour and crop proximity. Ground-level measurements—where human bodies actually encounter spores during outdoor work and leisure—reveal concentrations orders of magnitude above what regional rooftop monitoring networks detect, yet these measurements remain absent from standard allergen surveillance. The timing of peak Alternaria after harvest, rather than during it, suggests that crop disturbance mobilizes spores not only at the moment of mechanical harvesting but through subsequent soil and plant residue decomposition, creating a prolonged window of exposure tied to agricultural cycles. This study documents how exposure risk is not evenly distributed across landscapes but concentrated in proximity to arable land, implicating both the material practices of food production and the spatial positioning of human populations as determinants of who encounters elevated fungal allergen loads.",

High-throughput genetic sequencing revealed that clove extract treatment suppressed spoilage-associated microorganisms including Alternaria and Pantoea species while promoting populations of Bacillus bacteria.  The microbial shifts documented in this paper reveal a material entanglement characteristic of postharvest preservation: the same botanical extract that kills a primary pathogen simultaneously reshapes the broader microbial assemblage on fruit surfaces, favouring certain bacterial taxa over others. This selective suppression of spoilage organisms while promoting beneficial bacteria suggests that clove extract operates not as a blunt chemical fungicide but as a modifier of the competitive landscape among microorganisms inhabiting strawberry tissue—a shift that preserves fruit quality through ecological rather than purely antimicrobial means, yet remains contingent on storage conditions and the specific microbial composition of each harvest lot.",

    "source": "Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Fusarium culmorum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereals, leading to significant yield losses and contamination with type B trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives 3‐ADON and 15‐ADON. Due to the limitations of chemical fungicides, there is increasing interest in sustainable alternatives. Naturally occurring antioxidants have shown potential in modulating fungal growth and mycotoxin production. RESULTS This study evaluated the effects of 11 natural antioxidant compounds on Fusarium culmorum growth and trichothecene production, both in vitro and in planta. In vitro : octyl gallate ( 7 ), honokiol ( 9 ), and magnolol ( 10 ) completely inhibited fungal growth and trichothecene production at 0.5 mmol L −1 . In planta : octyl gallate ( 7 ), reduced the disease index to 0.63% and total mycotoxin levels by 90% while honokiol ( 9 ), and ascorbic acid ( 1 ) exhibited notable inhibition in both disease severity and mycotoxin accumulation. The equimolar combination of ascorbic acid and tocopherol demonstrated synergistic inhibition of DON and 3‐ADON in vitro , though its efficacy in planta was moderate. No correlation was found in vitro between the antioxidant or lipophilic properties and antifungal efficacy, whereas in planta experiments revealed a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and trichothecene suppression. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro–Wilks, Levene and analysis of variance tests ( P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Natural antioxidants, particularly octyl gallate and honokiol, represent promising candidates for controlling F. culmorum and reducing trichothecene contamination in cereals. Their application could contribute to safer food by reducing trichothecene levels through environmentally friendly strategies.

This paper tested 11 natural antioxidant compounds against the fungus in controlled conditions and in living cereal plants. In laboratory cultures, octyl gallate, honokiol, and magnolol completely stopped fungal growth and toxin production at a concentration of 0.5 millimoles per litre. In cereal plants, octyl gallate reduced disease severity to 0.63 percent and total mycotoxin levels by 90 percent, while honokiol and ascorbic acid also showed substantial suppression of both disease and toxin accumulation. A combination of ascorbic acid and tocopherol showed combined-effect suppression of deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol in laboratory conditions, though its effectiveness in plants was moderate.  Within cereal crops, the antioxidant capacity of these compounds correlated with their ability to suppress trichothecene production—a relationship not observed in laboratory cultures. This divergence reveals how the same natural compounds operate differently across material contexts: in the simplified chemistry of a petri dish, antioxidant strength does not predict fungal control, yet within the complex tissue environment of a growing plant, antioxidant activity becomes a reliable indicator of toxin suppression. The findings suggest that octyl gallate and honokiol function not simply as fungal poisons but as modulators of the plant-fungus interaction itself, their efficacy dependent on the living system in which they operate rather than on their chemical properties alone.",

    "summary": "This study examined how Lactobacillus rhamnosus MY-1, a bacterial strain capable of breaking down deoxynivalenol, protects intestinal cells and animal hosts from damage caused by this mycotoxin. The paper reports findings from both laboratory experiments using intestinal cell cultures and living mouse models. In cell cultures, the bacterial supernatant restored cell survival and reversed structural damage to cells exposed to deoxynivalenol. The strain reduced markers of cellular damage from oxidative stress, lowered inflammatory signalling molecules, and preserved the expression of proteins that maintain the physical integrity of the intestinal barrier. In mice, the bacterial treatment modulated the composition and diversity of gut microorganisms that had been disrupted by toxin exposure.  The dual capacity of this bacterial strain—simultaneously a consumer of a mould-derived poison and a modifier of the microbial ecosystem that follows contamination—reveals how remediation operates within the lived body. The restoration of barrier function and microbial balance does not erase the prior exposure to deoxynivalenol but rather absorbs and redirects its consequences, rendering the toxin metabolically useful while restoring a particular order to the gut ecology. This locates the probiotic not as a simple antidote but as an agent that transforms the material and biological aftermath of grain contamination into a recoverable state—a recovery that depends entirely on the strain's capacity to persist and function within the specific conditions of feed systems and animal bodies shaped by agricultural practice.",

The isolation of this bacterial symbiont in blood cultures may indicate active invasion by the mould *Rhizopus* or related species, even in patients lacking classical immunocompromising conditions such as haematologic malignancy or organ transplantation. The authors propose that transient physiologic stress—such as uncontrolled metabolic disease or acute infection—combined with disruption of physical barriers (respiratory epithelium, gastrointestinal mucosa, or skin) can permit fungal invasion in otherwise immunologically intact hosts. Early identification of *M. endofungorum* bacteremia could serve as a diagnostic signal for invasive mucormycosis before conventional clinical or radiological signs emerge, potentially enabling faster clinical intervention.  The finding reveals a material entanglement between human immune vulnerability and fungal-bacterial assemblages that operates outside conventional risk stratification. The same bacterial symbiont that signals danger—a marker of life-threatening fungal invasion—is ordinarily a benign inhabitant of fungal cytoplasm, mobilized into pathogenic circulation only when specific conditions of host stress and tissue breach align. This suggests that invasive mucormycosis is not simply a disease of the immune-weakened but emerges from contingent interactions between transient physiologic states, environmental exposure, and the metabolic capacities of fungal-bacterial partnerships. The diagnostic utility of detecting a symbiont rather than the pathogenic fungus itself demonstrates how clinical recognition of disease depends on understanding the relational ecologies of infection, not merely the presence of a single causative agent.",

Microbiological re-evaluation and molecular identification confirmed the causative agent as Fusarium keratoplasticum (F. keratoplasticum), a pathogenic species within Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC).

    "excerpt": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), primarily caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus, is a life-threatening fungal infection with high mortality rates. This study investigated novel resistance mechanisms to caspofungin (CAS) in clinical Aspergillus isolates with particular focus on genetic alterations in the CoQ5 gene and their functional implications. One hundred and forty-eight Aspergillus isolates from IPA cases were undergone antifungal susceptibility testing, genotyping and phylogenetic analyses, mutations and gene expression studies of Fks1 and CoQ5 genes, and three-dimensional structural analysis of wild-type and mutant CoQ5 proteins. The etiologic agents of IPA comprised A. flavus (72.3%) and A. fumigatus (27.7%). Caspofungin (CAS) resistance was reported in 7.4% of A. flavus and 9.7% of A. fumigatus isolates. Genetic analysis identified a novel mutation in the CoQ5 gene (T371C) resulting in an amino acid substitution (Y102H) in a CAS-resistant A. flavus isolate. Structural modeling suggests this variant may impair protein stability and mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to resistance through indirect mechanisms. The definitive establishment of causality and direct contribution of CoQ5 mutations to caspofungin susceptibility requires further functional validation by employing targeted genetic manipulation and phenotypic validation to directly interrogate the role of the Y102H variant in the resistance mechanism.",

The resistance mechanism documented here reveals a material entanglement between fungal metabolism and pharmaceutical pressure. The CoQ5 protein, which functions in cellular energy production within mitochondria, appears to be recruited into a resistance strategy not through direct interaction with the drug but through structural changes that destabilize the protein itself—a paradoxical mode where cellular dysfunction becomes a survival strategy.

    "summary": "Aspergillus fumigatus, a common environmental mould, established a brain abscess in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receiving zanubrutinib, a second-generation Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor approved for treating this blood cancer. The patient's white blood cell count remained within normal range, yet the fungal infection penetrated the central nervous system and presented as a space-occupying lesion resembling a tumour. Surgical removal of the abscess followed by antifungal treatment with voriconazole was undertaken; cultures confirmed the organism's sensitivity to both amphotericin and voriconazole. This paper documents what appears to be the first recorded case of an isolated brain abscess caused by Aspergillus fumigatus in a patient on zanubrutinib, despite the drug's reputation for a safer side effect profile than earlier Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.  The case reveals a material entanglement between pharmaceutical innovation and fungal risk that standard clinical monitoring fails to anticipate. A drug engineered to improve safety outcomes in cancer treatment paradoxically created conditions for a pathogenic fungus to establish itself in neural tissue—not through obvious immunosuppression marked by low white blood cell counts, but through more subtle disruptions in immune function that remain clinically invisible until the fungus has already colonized and grown. The mould here is neither simply a threat nor a resource, but a trace of the hidden costs embedded in the management of one disease through pharmaceutical intervention, costs that emerge unpredictably in individual bodies and remain difficult to detect through conventional clinical parameters.",

    "excerpt": "Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea has a severe impact on postharvest green beans, leading to quality degradation and substantial economic losses. The application of plant endophytic microorganisms has proven to be a reliable and safe strategy for controlling fungal diseases. In the present study, an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9, was isolated from healthy bean seeds and exhibited strong inhibitory activity against Botrytis cinerea. This strain could form biofilms, enhance the activity of defense enzymes, and boost the content of active secondary metabolites in green beans. The crude lipopeptide extracts from NEAU-HLD-9 remarkably suppressed the mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea. It is worth noting that the crude lipopeptide extracts also effectively controlled gray mold in green beans by reducing both disease incidence and lesion diameter. PCR and LC-MS analyses suggested that the crude lipopeptide extracts comprised two antifungal compounds. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the strain contained 15 gene clusters responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis, including those for antifungal compounds. In summary, both Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9 and its crude lipopeptide extracts strongly inhibited Botrytis cinerea in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a promising approach for the management of gray mold in green beans.",

    "summary": "This paper describes the isolation of a seed-dwelling bacterium, Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9, from healthy bean seeds and its capacity to suppress gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea in postharvest green beans. The strain demonstrated inhibitory activity against the pathogen both in laboratory conditions and on stored beans, reducing disease incidence and the size of lesions on fruit tissue. The bacterium produced surface-bound microbial communities and elevated the activity of plant defense enzymes and secondary metabolites within green bean tissue. Chemical analysis using polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified two antifungal compounds within crude lipopeptide extracts derived from the strain, and whole genome sequencing revealed 15 gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite production, including those encoding antifungal substances. When applied as crude lipopeptide extracts, these compounds suppressed both mycelial growth and spore germination of Botrytis cinerea laboratory-based and reduced disease on stored green beans in living organisms.  Within postharvest commodity chains, this bacterium and its chemical products operate simultaneously as disease suppressors and as metabolic interventions that alter the biochemistry of the host plant itself. The same lipopeptide compounds that inhibit fungal growth also restructure the plant's own defense apparatus—a dual action that reveals how microbial control does not simply remove a pathogen but redistributes biological activity across the human-crop-microbe assemblage. The capacity of Bacillus velezensis to colonize seeds and persist within plant tissue, while simultaneously producing antifungal metabolites, demonstrates how a single organism can serve as both a living intervention technology and a source of extractable compounds, each with distinct economic and logistical implications for agricultural systems managing spoilage in stored green beans.",

Results demonstrated that A. pullulans S2 significantly reduced both the incidence and severity of disease while enhancing the activity of enzymes related to defense and the accumulation of antioxidant compounds. Additionally, 2-Phenylethanol generated by A. pullulans S2 exhibited strong antifungal properties by disrupting the cell membrane integrity and promoting reactive oxygen species accumulation in pathogens. Furthermore, a lyophilized formulation of A. pullulans S2 was developed using an optimized protective agent combination via response surface methodology. This resulted in a high post-lyophilization survival rate of 85.2 % and significant biocontrol efficacy after 90 days of storage. These results underscore the potential of A. pullulans S2 as a potent biocontrol agent for postharvest grape diseases.",

    "summary": "Red grapes are susceptible to postharvest infections from two fungal pathogens—Aspergillus niger, which causes black mold, and Botrytis cinerea, which causes gray mold—owing to their thin skin and nutrient-dense flesh. This paper tested Aureobasidium pullulans S2, a fungal biocontrol agent, against these infections and found that it reduced both the occurrence and severity of disease while strengthening the grape's own defense enzyme activity and accumulation of protective compounds. The mechanism of action involved a volatile organic compound called 2-Phenylethanol, produced by A. pullulans S2, which damaged the cell membranes of the pathogenic fungi and triggered the buildup of reactive oxygen species—molecules that degrade cellular components—within those pathogens. The researchers also developed a freeze-dried formulation of A. pullulans S2 using optimized protective agents, achieving an 85.2 percent survival rate of the organism after the freeze-drying process and maintaining significant disease control capacity after 90 days of storage.  This study documents the dual material capacity of a fungal agent: A. pullulans S2 operates simultaneously as a disease suppressor and as a preserved commodity. The freeze-dried formulation reveals the dependencies embedded in biocontrol—the organism's efficacy depends on its survival through industrial processing and extended storage, transforming a living antagonist into a shelf-stable product whose viability must be engineered and maintained. The pathogenic moulds themselves become sites where multiple metabolic processes converge: they are agricultural threats requiring management, yet their vulnerability to A. pullulans S2's chemical outputs exposes how fungal interactions in postharvest systems are shaped by material conditions—skin integrity, nutrient availability, storage duration—that are themselves products of agricultural and commercial practice.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Genetics and Biology",
    "excerpt": "Regulated cell death (RCD) is a highly conserved and coordinated cellular demise process. In animals, the fate of cells depends on the precise regulation of RCD, with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) playing a major role as negative regulators of cellular death. In fungi, RCD regulates crucial processes, including growth, development, stress response, host-pathogen interactions and more. However, the biochemical details of this process are not well understood in this kingdom. IAPs are, remarkably, one of the few RCD/Apoptosis-regulatory proteins that are conserved in fungi. Here, we performed large-scale bioinformatic analyses of IAPs in sequenced fungal genomes. While most fungal organisms have a single IAP gene (81.65 % of the genomes analyzed here), some fungi lack IAPs altogether and others have multiple IAP-like genes. Using the Aspergillus nidulans IAP, AnBir1, we show that this protein is required for survival and regulates cell death by inhibiting caspase-like activity. Moreover, disrupting RCD by constitutively expressing AnBir1 impacted fundamental processes, including development, stress response and secondary metabolism. We also show that fungal RCD can be hijacked for therapeutic purposes. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we targeted the AnBir1 homolog of the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SsBir1) during plant infection. Targeting SsBir1 resulted in enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum infection. We propose that IAPs play a critical role in regulating caspase activities and other RCD-related processes in fungi and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for fungal infections.",

    "summary": "This paper documents the discovery and functional characterization of AnBir1, a cell death inhibitor protein in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Through large-scale analysis of fungal genomes, this study found that most fungi (81.65 percent of those analyzed) carry a single gene encoding inhibitor of programmed cell death proteins, though some species lack these genes entirely while others possess multiple copies. Using Aspergillus nidulans as a model organism, the researchers demonstrated that AnBir1 is essential for cell survival and functions by suppressing caspase-like enzymes that would otherwise trigger programmed cell death. When AnBir1 was artificially overexpressed to prevent cell death, the fungus showed altered development, reduced stress tolerance, and changes in secondary metabolism—the production of specialized chemical compounds. The paper also tested whether disrupting this cell death pathway could serve as a disease control strategy by silencing the AnBir1 equivalent in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a fungus that infects plants, and found that this genetic intervention enhanced plant resistance to infection.  Within the context of fungal-human and fungal-plant entanglements, this research reveals how a single regulatory protein simultaneously enables fungal survival and constrains adaptive capacity. The same mechanism that allows Aspergillus nidulans to persist—the suppression of programmed cell death—also locks the organism into particular developmental and metabolic pathways, making it vulnerable when that pathway is disrupted. This duality suggests that fungal pathogens operate within narrow biochemical constraints; targeting cell death inhibition in plant pathogens like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum exploits this constraint as a point of intervention, yet the finding also exposes how deeply fungal fitness depends on the precise regulation of cellular demise across stress, growth, and host interaction.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Mitochondria play a central role in fungal metabolism, adaptation, and pathogenesis, yet the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial genomes in plant-pathogenic Alternaria species remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative mitochondrial genomes analysis of five economically important Alternaria species-Alternaria burnsii, A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata, and A. gossypina-to investigate structural architecture, genomic variation, selection pressures, repeat element dynamics, and phylogenetic relationships. The mitochondrial genomes exhibited a conserved gene content of 13-14 core genes, 30-33 tRNA and 2 rRNA, but varied in size due to differences in intron insertions, intergenic spacers, and repetitive sequences. Strong A/U-biased codon usage was observed across species, consistent with high AT-richness and translational optimization. Purifying selection dominated across essential respiratory complexes (cox1-3, atp6-9 and cob), indicating functional constraint, while signals of positive selection and pseudogenization (disrupted rps3 in A. burnsii YUN-Z1107) suggest lineage-specific adaptations. We identified evolutionary hotspots in both coding and non-coding regions enriched with InDeLs and repeat expansions. A total of 920 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were annotated, with A. burnsii YUN-Z1107 showing the highest SSR density, particularly pentanucleotide motifs, implicating replication slippage in genome plasticity. Long repetitive elements were associated with intron mobility and possible recombination events, especially in A. arborescens YUN-Z0872. Phylogenomic analysis of 29 Ascomycota species confirmed a monophyletic Alternaria clade within Pleosporales, although limited resolution within the genus suggests complex evolutionary histories.

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), 37 % of French dwellings are contaminated by molds, particularly Aspergillus species. Among these, Aspergillus creber is the most frequently detected in the bioaerosols of mold-damaged dwellings and may be contribute to various health disorders. In the context of climate change, with indoor temperatures potentially exceeding 28 °C in summer, and amid the ongoing energy crisis, the French government recommends maintaining indoor temperature at 19 °C. This raises concerns about the effects of climatic conditions i.e. temperature (T°) and relative humidity (RH), on fungal growth, sterigmatocystin (STE) production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these molds. We therefore cultured three reference strains of Aspergillus creber under four common dwelling conditions (A: 19 °C, 50 % RH; B 19 °C, 75 % RH; C: 28 °C, 50 % RH; D: 28 °C, 75 % RH) on five different culture media (MEA, MEA+10 % NaCl, CYA, CY20S, and M40Y). Temperature significantly influenced growth (mean diameters: 19 °C: 22.8 mm; 28 °C: 34.4 mm; mean biomasses: 19 °C: 108.3 mg; 28 °C: 329.1 mg), STE production (mean concentrations: 19 °C: 3.5 μg/g/28 °C: 34.5 μg/g), and the MICs of antifungal agents, with a notable association between increased temperature and elevated MICs. The highest STE production (up to 99 μg/g) occurred at 28 °C on M40Y agar. Positive correlations were observed between diameters and biomass (r = 0.791; p < 0.0001), diameters and STE production (r = 0.431; p < 0.0001), and biomass and STE production (r = 0.305; p < 0.0001), suggesting a strong link between primary growth and secondary metabolism. These findings highlight the potential health risks posed by rising indoor temperatures, as projected under global climate change, which may lead to increased STE production in Aspergillus creber.",

This paper found that temperature was the dominant driver of fungal behaviour across all measured parameters. At 19 degrees Celsius, colonies grew to mean diameters of 22.8 millimetres and accumulated mean biomass of 108.3 milligrams, while at 28 degrees Celsius these values increased substantially to 34.4 millimetres and 329.1 milligrams respectively. Sterigmatocystin, a toxic secondary metabolite produced by the fungus, showed even more dramatic temperature sensitivity: mean production was 3.5 micrograms per gram at 19 degrees Celsius but jumped to 34.5 micrograms per gram at 28 degrees Celsius, with peak production reaching 99 micrograms per gram on one growth medium at the higher temperature. The study also documented that higher temperatures correlated with increased resistance to antifungal agents. Strong positive correlations linked colony diameter to biomass accumulation, diameter to toxin production, and biomass to toxin production, indicating that faster-growing colonies at warmer temperatures also produce more of this toxic compound.  The material conditions of indoor dwelling — temperature regimes shaped by energy policy, climate change projections, and housing standards — directly structure both the metabolic capacity and chemical output of this fungus. The tension between government recommendations to lower indoor temperatures for energy conservation and the simultaneous projection of warming climates creates a volatile ecological niche where Aspergillus creber can shift from a slow-growing, lower-toxin producer to a rapidly proliferating, high-toxin producer. This paper documents how climatic stress and policy-driven dwelling conditions do not simply expose residents to existing fungal hazards, but actively reshape the hazard itself — transforming the organism into a more chemically aggressive form within the very spaces designed for human habitation.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Fusarium wilt, commonly referred to as Panama disease, stands as the most catastrophic disease in banana cultivation. Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), it has imposed substantial economic burdens on banana farmers worldwide. Foc4-SIX13 was identified as a potential effector in Foc4, and is characterized by secretion into xylem. It is a protein comprised of 312 amino acids, and features a functional signal peptide without recognizable motifs or domains. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the expression of Foc4-SIX13 was markedly upregulated during the initial stage of fungal infection in banana plants. Through homologous recombination, the successful knockout of Foc4-SIX13 was accomplished. The resulting deletion mutant exhibited impaired mycelial growth and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress, coupled with a significant decrease in pathogenicity towards bananas. Foc4-SIX13Δsp could not induce cellular necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that Foc4-SIX13Δsp was localized in both cytoplasm and nuclei of N. benthamiana cells. The interaction between Foc4-SIX13 and banana Nudix hydrolase 23 (Ma-NUD23) was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Taken together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Foc4-SIX13 in the pathogenicity of Foc4 and its importance in the Fusarium infection process. Consequently, Foc4-SIX13 is proposed as a promising target for future management strategies against Fusarium wilt, and it can provide a novel avenue for the breeding of banana varieties with enhanced disease resistance.",

This paper identifies Foc4-SIX13, a 312-amino-acid protein secreted into the plant's water-conducting vessels, as a key infection-enabling traits produced by the fungus during early infection. When researchers deleted the gene encoding Foc4-SIX13, the resulting fungal mutant showed reduced growth, heightened vulnerability to osmotic stress, and substantially diminished ability to infect banana plants. The protein localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of plant cells and directly interacts with a banana enzyme called Nudix hydrolase 23, which the fungus appears to target as part of its infection strategy.  The material entanglement documented here reveals how a single fungal protein operates simultaneously as a pathogenic weapon and a point of vulnerability. The same molecular mechanism that enables the fungus to suppress plant defences and establish infection—the hijacking of the banana plant's own enzymatic machinery—also creates a discrete target for breeding disease-resistant banana varieties or developing intervention strategies. What emerges is not simply a pathogen-host relationship but a specific biochemical dependency that could be disrupted, suggesting that understanding the fungus's reliance on particular plant proteins may offer more durable resistance than strategies targeting the fungus alone.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Hazardous Materials",
    "excerpt": "The widespread use of polypropylene-based surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated environmental plastic pollution, necessitating sustainable degradation strategies. This study investigates the biodegradation potential of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii on nonwoven polypropylene mask layers under both nutrient-rich (MSM broth) and soil microcosm conditions. A multidisciplinary approach combining weight loss measurements, FTIR-ATR spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize physical, chemical, and biochemical changes in the polymer matrix. Results show that A. bridgerii induced significant degradation in both environments, with the highest weight loss % observed in MSM microcosms (20.38 ± 0.29 %), indicating active fragmentation and partial mineralization. In soil microcosms, fungal inoculation led to the most advanced oxidation (SAUB CI up to ∼4.6), extensive surface fragmentation, and the release of unique volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including DEHP (∼15 % GC-MS area) and long-chain ketones. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by the lowest residual mask mass (9.48 ± 0.19 %), suggesting enhanced mineralization in the nutrient-limited soil. SEM analysis further confirmed pronounced fiber degradation and biofilm formation. These findings underscore the role of fungal metabolism and environmental context in modulating polypropylene decay, supporting a multiple mechanistic process such as oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation. The integration of FTIR, SEM, and GC-MS provided robust evidence of mask polymer degradation and highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii as a bioremediation agent for PPE waste.",

    "summary": "This study documents the capacity of the plant-internal microbe fungus Aspergillus bridgerii to degrade polypropylene nonwoven fabric from surgical masks under controlled laboratory conditions. The fungus achieved a weight loss of 20.38 percent in nutrient-rich broth microcosms and 9.48 percent in soil microcosms, with the soil environment producing more advanced chemical oxidation and the release of volatile organic compounds including diethyl phthalate and long-chain ketones. Physical analysis via scanning electron microscopy revealed pronounced fiber fragmentation and surface-colonising microbial communities on mask surfaces, while infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed chemical transformation of the polymer matrix. The research demonstrates that fungal degradation operates through multiple mechanisms—oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation—with environmental context (nutrient availability, soil composition) modulating the rate and extent of polymer breakdown.  The findings reveal a material entanglement characteristic of pandemic waste streams: the same fungal metabolism that poses risks in clinical or indoor settings can also function as a decomposition agent for discarded protective equipment. Aspergillus bridgerii's ability to fragment and mineralize polypropylene in soil—where nutrient scarcity paradoxically accelerates degradation—points to how fungal adaptation to resource-limited conditions reshapes synthetic materials into metabolizable growth media. This paper documents not a solution to mask waste but rather a situated ecological process in which a fungal species transforms accumulated pandemic infrastructure into chemical byproducts and fungal biomass, demonstrating how the same organism operates simultaneously as both a potential biological cleanup pathway and a vector of material transformation shaped by the specific chemical and nutritional conditions of its habitat.",

    "excerpt": "Sludge dewatering is vital for reducing volume and energy consumption, yet traditional chemical conditioners are limited by cost and environmental concerns. Herein, a green fungal flocculant was developed by cultivating Aspergillus niger using food waste hydrolysate as the sole substrate, achieving a biomass yield of 140.3 mg/g-chemical oxygen demand. Alkaline modification effectively altered surface chemistry by degrading hydrophilic amide groups, enhancing hydrophobicity, surface charge repulsion, and hyphal dispersion. When applied as a coagulant aid with 3% FeCl3, the base-modified fungal flocculant markedly improved sludge dewatering, increasing Dx(90) from 102.0 to 1542.9 μm and reducing specific resistance to filtration by 75.7%, with a final cake water content of 56.8%. Mechanistic analyses revealed that improved fungal network porosity, enhanced hydrophobic interactions, and coordination between fungal functional groups and Fe3+ ions synergistically facilitated water release. This bio-based strategy offers a sustainable alternative that simultaneously valorizes food waste and replaces synthetic polymeric flocculants in sludge treatment.",

    "summary": "Aspergillus niger was cultured on food waste hydrolysate as a growth growth medium, yielding 140.3 milligrams of fungal biomass per gram of chemical oxygen demand. The fungal material was then chemically modified using alkaline treatment, which removed hydrophilic amide groups from the fungal cell surface and increased its water-repelling properties. When this modified fungal material was used alongside ferric chloride in sludge treatment, it substantially improved water removal: the size of dewatered particles increased from 102.0 to 1542.9 micrometers, and the resistance of the sludge to filtration decreased by 75.7%, leaving a final cake with 56.8% water content. This paper attributes the improved performance to three interconnected mechanisms—increased porosity in the fungal network structure, stronger water-repelling interactions at the fungal surface, and chemical bonding between fungal molecules and iron ions.  The fungal flocculant represents a material entanglement characteristic of the Patchy Anthropocene: food waste, typically a marker of surplus and disposal in industrial food systems, becomes growth medium for microbial growth and subsequent valorization as a treatment technology. Yet this transformation does not erase the material dependencies embedded in the process—the fungal flocculant still requires ferric chloride as a coagulant aid, and its efficacy depends on alkaline modification, both chemical interventions that shift rather than eliminate the industrial chemistry of sludge treatment. The fungal biomass thus occupies an ambiguous position: simultaneously a \"green\" alternative to synthetic polymers and a product of the same metabolic and chemical logics that characterize industrial waste management.",

The fungus was modified to overexpress a transporter protein from Aspergillus oryzae that enhances the secretion of malic acid, while adjustments to growth medium conditions further boosted production. The engineered strain successfully metabolized individual lignin-derived aromatic compounds, including 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid, producing up to 3.9 grams of malic acid per litre of culture.

Lignin valorization through fungal conversion reveals a material entanglement characteristic of the Patchy Anthropocene: the same recalcitrant waste stream that accumulates in pulp mills and biorefinery residues becomes, through fungal metabolic engineering, a growth medium for chemical synthesis. The heterogeneity that makes lignin difficult to process conventionally—its variable aromatic composition across plant species and processing methods—becomes, in this fungal system, a feature the organism can navigate rather than an obstacle. What emerges is not simply a cleaner production pathway but a redistribution of economic value: lignin shifts from a low-value byproduct burned for energy to a feedstock for higher-value chemical synthesis, a transformation that depends entirely on the fungus's capacity to metabolize materials humans have struggled to use.",

Firstly, an SSL backbone network was constructed to perform a spectral reconstruction task on masked spectra, providing pre-trained weights for subsequent supervised learning. Secondly, the spectral reconstruction error was innovatively used as a wavelength attention mechanism, integrated with the fine-tuned encoder from the SSL stage to develop a classification model. This model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9805 ± 0.0019 in peanuts and 0.9478 ± 0.0060 in maize, outperforming other deep learning models. Furthermore, key wavelengths were selected based on the spectral reconstruction error.

This paper develops a detection method using self-supervised learning on spectral data—a machine learning approach where a neural network first learns patterns from unlabeled spectral measurements by reconstructing masked portions of spectra, then applies this knowledge to classify whether aflatoxin B1 is present. The method achieved detection accuracy of 98.05 per cent in peanuts and 94.78 per cent in maize, surpassing other deep learning approaches tested. The researchers identified 40 key wavelengths of light that carry the most diagnostic information about aflatoxin presence, selected through analysis of reconstruction errors from the self-supervised stage.  The detection apparatus itself—spectral measurement of grain kernels—operates at the intersection of agricultural commodity flows and toxin surveillance. Aflatoxin B1 emerges here not merely as a pathogenic metabolite requiring elimination, but as a detectable material signature embedded in grain destined for human and animal consumption. The method's efficiency with limited training samples suggests potential deployment in contexts where grain testing infrastructure remains sparse or where rapid screening of high-volume commodity batches is economically necessary. Yet the technology's capacity to identify contaminated grain also depends on access to spectral scanning equipment and computational resources, making detection itself a distributed capacity shaped by capital investment in agricultural supply chains rather than a neutral technical capability.",

In this article, use of unconventional technologies like irradiation, ozonation, cold activated plasma, magnetic nanoparticles, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, pulsed light, natural essential oils and phytochemicals in controlling growth of toxigenic fungi and degrading mycotoxins in various foodstuffs have been reviewed. The efficacy of decontamination of different types of major mycotoxins by these novel techniques and the associated safety and limitation factors have been analysed and discussed in detail.

    "summary": "This paper surveys decontamination methods for mycotoxins in food and feed, comparing conventional approaches with emerging technologies. The conventional techniques addressed in this review have proven inadequate because mycotoxin molecules are structurally resistant to degradation. The unconventional technologies examined include irradiation, ozonation, cold activated plasma, magnetic nanoparticles, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, pulsed light, natural essential oils, and phytochemicals—all evaluated for their capacity to inhibit toxigenic fungi growth and break down mycotoxins across different food commodities. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of these novel techniques against major mycotoxin types, alongside their safety profiles and practical limitations. The review also considers combinations of multiple unconventional techniques and assesses the technical, economic, and environmental factors that determine whether these advanced technologies can be scaled up for large-scale implementation.  Within food systems shaped by global trade and storage infrastructure, mycotoxin contamination emerges as both a persistent hazard requiring technological intervention and a site where novel decontamination methods generate new dependencies and costs. The shift from conventional to unconventional technologies—from simple physical removal to plasma activation and nanoparticle deployment—reveals how food safety increasingly depends on energy-intensive, capital-heavy systems whose adoption remains uneven across regions and commodity chains. The paper's attention to techno-economic-environmental trade-offs suggests that no single decontamination method resolves the underlying material problem; instead, the choice of technique redistributes risk and resource demand across different stages of production and storage.",

The beads work by combining recognition molecules—antibodies, aptamers, or molecularly imprinted polymers—with magnetic carriers to isolate and concentrate mycotoxins from food samples. According to this paper, affinity magnetic beads address persistent problems in mycotoxin detection: they reduce the labour-intensive sample preparation steps that precede analysis, diminish interference from other food components, and integrate readily with automated detection systems. The review evaluates how these beads enhance both traditional chromatographic methods and rapid on-site screening techniques, assessing their capacity to improve detection sensitivity and accuracy across different recognition chemistries.  Within food systems shaped by storage conditions, labour constraints, and capital investment in safety infrastructure, affinity magnetic beads represent a technical intervention that simultaneously reveals and obscures the material conditions of contamination. The beads make mycotoxin detection faster and more automated, yet this efficiency depends on their ability to selectively bind and remove toxins that accumulate precisely because of the economic pressures—inadequate storage facilities, moisture control, and supply chain monitoring—that characterize food production in many regions. Detection technology thus becomes a proxy for managing risk rather than addressing the structural vulnerabilities that allow fungal proliferation and toxin accumulation in the first place.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the chemical composition remained consistent across production batches. The essential oil demonstrated strong antifungal activity against A. alternata in laboratory conditions (with a concentration needed to inhibit 50 percent of fungal growth at 0.0718 microliters per milliliter), and when applied to tomato fruit, it reduced the size of decay lesions and lowered levels of two mycotoxins produced by the fungus: alternariol and tenuazonic acid. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, protein analysis, and physiological measurements showed the essential oil worked through multiple mechanisms—damaging the fungal cell membrane, disrupting energy production, and triggering oxidative stress—and toxicity testing in mice confirmed its safety for use.  Within postharvest tomato storage, the essential oil emerges as both a remediation technology and a material dependency. The fungus itself—capable of rapid adaptation and toxin production under the stresses of storage conditions—becomes simultaneously a threat to commodity value and a driver of the demand for botanical interventions.

He initially responded to ganciclovir, but CMVR recurred five months later, accompanied by new pulmonary nodules. Despite negative conventional microbiological tests, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified co-infection with Tropheryma whipplei and P. digitatum.

    "summary": "A 66-year-old man presented with blurred vision caused by cytomegalovirus retinitis, accompanied by severely depleted CD4+ T-cell counts (102 cells per microliter) and high levels of cytomegalovirus genetic material in blood and eye fluid. Initial treatment with ganciclovir produced temporary improvement, but the retinal infection recurred five months later alongside new lung nodules. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing of fluid obtained from bronchoscopy identified two simultaneous pulmonary infections: Tropheryma whipplei and Penicillium digitatum, organisms that conventional laboratory testing had failed to detect. The patient's profound immunosuppression and this specific combination of infections—cytomegalovirus retinitis together with pulmonary co-infection by these two organisms—prompted investigation that revealed Epstein–Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive blood cancer that had remained undiagnosed until these opportunistic infections surfaced.  The clinical sequence documented in this case illustrates how a single malignancy can orchestrate multiple simultaneous microbial invasions across different body sites. The lymphoma's disruption of immune function created conditions permitting not just one but two fungal and bacterial pathogens to establish pulmonary infection, while simultaneously enabling cytomegalovirus to breach the eye—a pattern that reveals the material entanglement between malignant human cells and opportunistic microorganisms. What appears clinically as separate infections is, in this instance, a unified phenomenon rooted in the cancer's capacity to unmake the body's defenses, transforming the patient into a growth medium where multiple microbial species can flourish in concert.",

The authors examine the most commonly used diagnostic assays for detecting these organisms, evaluate their performance in immune-weakened hosts, and identify gaps in how diagnostic testing is currently managed. The paper notes that while antifungal medications and fungal diagnostic testing have become increasingly widespread, these clinical practices have not been subject to the same systematic stewardship frameworks that guide bacterial infection management. The authors argue that implementing fungal diagnostic stewardship—by reducing unnecessary testing, improving test selection, and refining diagnostic strategies—could decrease diagnostic errors and ultimately improve outcomes for vulnerable patients.  Within the context of the Patchy Anthropocene, this diagnostic stewardship framework reveals a critical tension: the same fungi that threaten immune-weakened bodies also drive the expansion of testing infrastructure, antifungal markets, and clinical protocols. Diagnostic uncertainty around molds and dimorphic fungi—organisms that colonize both clinical specimens and hospital environments—creates dependencies on increasingly sophisticated detection methods, which in turn shape patterns of treatment and pharmaceutical use. The paper's focus on stewardship in immune-weakened populations documents how fungal pathogens become sites where clinical vulnerability, diagnostic technology, and pharmaceutical intervention become materially entangled, with the capacity to both harm and to generate new forms of medical authority and economic activity.",

The study enrolled 238 non-neutropenic adults with suspected infection across three tertiary hospitals between December 2020 and December 2024, identifying 134 confirmed cases and 104 non-cases. The researchers used targeted next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid—the fluid obtained by bronchoscopy from the lower airways—to quantify Aspergillus genetic material, stratifying results into low, medium, and high tiers. Patients with confirmed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis showed elevated rates of diabetes (73.9%) and corticosteroid use compared to those without infection. The study built a multivariable logistic regression model incorporating clinical, radiological, and microbiological variables, validated through internal resampling methods, and assessed diagnostic accuracy using receiver operating characteristic analysis.  The findings reveal how a respiratory infection diagnosis becomes entangled with markers of metabolic and immunological vulnerability—diabetes and corticosteroid dependency—that reflect broader patterns of chronic disease management and pharmaceutical exposure in hospital populations. The shift from qualitative pathogen detection to quantified fungal load creates a new diagnostic object: the stratified Aspergillus measure becomes simultaneously a clinical threshold and a site where host fragility and microbial abundance are rendered commensurable, collapsing the distinction between what constitutes infection risk and what constitutes infection itself.",

    "excerpt": "SUMMARY Iatrogenic central nervous system mold infections (ICNSMIs) are rare and occur as sporadic complications of neurosurgical procedures or device insertions. However, recent outbreaks have been reported in outpatient settings, following epidural injections with contaminated medicines. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies published without date restrictions through July 2025 on ICNSMIs. We identified 905 cases of such infections, with 4% occurring in non-outbreak settings and 96% associated with five documented outbreaks. In both non-outbreak and outbreak settings, infections were more common after spinal/epidural injections, with contaminated medicines or supplies being the primary source. Due to their angioinvasive tendencies, ICNSMI caused by Fusarium solani and Aspergillus species had a higher frequency of stroke/intracranial hemorrhage ( P = 0.011), aneurysm formation ( P = 0.012), and resulted in higher mortality compared with ICNSMI caused by other molds ( P &lt; 0.001). ICNSMI, as a result of catheter-associated fungemia, was very rare (only one case). Strategies to identify ICNSMI in exposed individuals during an outbreak have included (i) symptom-driven lumbar puncture, (ii) screening lumbar puncture regardless of symptoms, and (iii) screening brain MRI regardless of symptoms. Measurement of (1→3)-β-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid was a valuable tool to diagnose ICNSMI preemptively. Outcomes of ICNSMI following neurosurgical procedures were poor (90-day mortality of 35%) and depended on the route of inoculation, mold species, timing of diagnosis, and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy in combination with source control. Patients with ICNSMI often suffered long-term neurologic sequelae, even with the most optimal management strategies.",

    "summary": "Iatrogenic central nervous system mold infections occur predominantly in outbreak settings, with this paper identifying 905 documented cases across the literature, of which 96% were associated with five major outbreaks and only 4% occurred sporadically. The infections resulted from contaminated medicines or medical supplies introduced during spinal and epidural injections rather than from catheter-associated fungemia, which accounted for only a single case. Fusarium solani and Aspergillus species demonstrated higher angioinvasive capacity than other molds, leading to significantly elevated rates of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and aneurysm formation, alongside substantially higher mortality. Measurement of a fungal cell wall component in cerebrospinal fluid proved effective for early diagnosis, and outcomes depended critically on the mold species involved, timing of diagnosis, and rapid initiation of antifungal treatment combined with source control, though 90-day mortality following neurosurgical procedures reached 35% and survivors frequently experienced lasting neurological damage.  These outbreaks reveal how medical interventions designed to relieve pain or treat neurological conditions become vectors for mold colonization when supply chains fail—a pattern shaped by the material vulnerabilities of injectable medicines and the difficulty of maintaining sterility across distributed outpatient networks. The same Aspergillus and Fusarium species that pose clinical threats also expose the fragility of contemporary medical infrastructure; their capacity to invade blood vessels and cause hemorrhage within the nervous system transforms a contamination event into a cascade of vascular rupture and tissue death, making outbreak response dependent not only on clinical vigilance but on the ability to trace contaminated batches backward through supply chains and forward into exposed populations.",

    "title": "Contribution of terrestrial processes in reducing environmental mycotoxin levels: a review on mycotoxin-soil interactions",
    "source": "Latest Results",
    "excerpt": "Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that can harm humans and animals. They occur primarily in infected crops, with higher levels under environmental stress. Their origin in contaminated crops is the main contributor to soil contamination. Although high levels can be detected in soils, these are transitory and in average far lower than in contaminated crops, indicating a key role of functioning soils in down-regulating environmental mycotoxin levels. This review examines mycotoxin-soil interactions in terms of four terrestrial processes: (i) adsorption to soil fractions, (ii) microbial transformation and mineralisation (iii) transport/mobilization with water, (iv) plant uptake and response. Results show that the main process for dissipation in soils is microbial, improved by biomass and activity and by a narrow fungi-to-bacteria ratio. This aligns with incubation studies suggesting a key role of bacteria in the degradation of mycotoxins. This path is favoured by the availability of the mycotoxins, that can be reduced by the adsorption to soil particles: the aromatic character and the carbonyl functions are decisive for adsorption to soil organic matter and clay particles, respectively. Consequently, mycotoxin levels in environmental compartments can be interpreted as the (net) result of entry and dissipation processes mediated through the soil, rather than the soil acting as a source of them. Plant uptake represents a minor pathway of contamination compared to the in situ production. In soil-plant systems, suboptimal nitrogen (N) and pesticide management are factors triggering fungal infestation and mycotoxins levels. Fungal infestation and mycotoxin can induce the polyphenolic response of the plant, along with mycotoxin metabolization as reported for DON. Based on this newly-made interpretation, this review provides future perspectives on mycotoxin occurrence and fate under climate change and intensive agriculture and proposes soil-based strategies for an integral env",

    "summary": "Soils function as active filters that reduce environmental mycotoxin levels rather than amplifying them, according to this review. The paper identifies four terrestrial processes mediating mycotoxin fate: binding to soil particles, microbial breakdown and complete mineralization, movement through water, and uptake by plants. Microbial degradation emerges as the dominant dissipation pathway, with bacterial activity playing a central role—a process enhanced by greater microbial biomass and a narrow ratio of fungi to bacteria in the soil community. The chemical structure of mycotoxins determines their behavior: aromatic compounds bind preferentially to soil organic matter, while those containing carbonyl groups attach to clay particles, reducing their availability for further transport or uptake. Plant uptake of mycotoxins from soil represents a minor contamination route compared to direct fungal infection of crops during growth.  Environmental mycotoxin levels thus reflect a balance between entry from contaminated crops and active removal through soil processes, not soil as a source of toxins. Under conditions of suboptimal nitrogen management and pesticide use, plants become more susceptible to fungal infection and mycotoxin accumulation, yet simultaneously mount defensive responses—including the production of protective compounds and metabolic transformation of some mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol. This reveals soil not as inert growth medium but as a working system where microbial communities and plant physiology together regulate the fate of fungal poisons, with implications for how agricultural intensification and climate pressures reshape these mediating relationships.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are common and often fatal in severe burn patients due to skin barrier loss and immune dysfunction. However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Aspergillus , Mucorales, and Fusarium ) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) ( P &lt; 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus , and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

    "summary": "Severe burn patients with damaged skin and impaired immune function frequently develop invasive mold infections, yet diagnostic criteria designed for other patient populations do not reliably identify these infections in this group. This paper evaluated how different diagnostic methods—direct microscopy of tissue samples, fungal culture from respiratory secretions and skin biopsies, species-specific genetic detection in blood and tissue samples, and serum galactomannan testing—performed in 276 burn patients admitted between 2014 and 2023 with burns covering at least 15 percent of total body surface area. Among 6,184 samples tested, 489 were positive for mold; skin biopsies yielded 281 positive results while blood tests detected 132 positive results. Ninety-three patients (33.7 percent) showed at least one positive diagnostic criterion, with Aspergillus detected in 25.7 percent of patients, Mucorales in 10.9 percent, and Fusarium in 9.8 percent. Patient mortality increased sharply with the number of positive diagnostic criteria detected: 12.7 percent mortality with no positive criteria, 10.7 percent with one or two criteria, 27.3 percent with three or four criteria, and 46.7 percent with five or more criteria. The paper notes that genetic detection in blood was most sensitive for Mucorales (81.3 percent of cases with skin involvement), moderately sensitive for Aspergillus (40 percent), and least sensitive for Fusarium (15.4 percent).  Within burn units, molds simultaneously mark clinical deterioration and reveal the material vulnerabilities of severely injured bodies—the compromised skin barrier and suppressed immune response create conditions where multiple mold species can establish simultaneous infections. The escalating mortality tied to cumulative positive diagnostic criteria suggests that the presence of multiple molds is not incidental but constitutive of a particular state of bodily breakdown in which burn injury has created a permissive growth medium for fungal colonization. The diagnostic challenge documented here reflects a deeper entanglement: the same diagnostic tools designed to detect pathogenic molds in other contexts must be recalibrated for burn patients, where the ecology of infection is fundamentally altered by trauma and where clinical outcomes depend not on detecting a single pathogen but on recognizing the assemblage of multiple fungal species that exploit the same damaged tissues.",

    "source": "Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), a potent mycotoxin frequently detected in improperly stored poultry feed, induces hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa , exhibits strong antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities; however, its efficacy and mechanisms in mitigating AFB 1 ‐induced hepatotoxicity in broilers remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary CUR supplementation on growth performance and liver health of broilers exposed to AFB 1 . RESULTS A total of 720 broilers (eight replicates of 15 birds each per treatment) were fed a basal diet, an AFB₁‐contaminated diet (1 mg kg −1 ), or AFB 1 diets supplemented with CUR (100, 300, or 500 mg kg −1 ) for 42 days. AFB 1 exposure significantly reduced average daily gain and increased feed conversion ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas CUR supplementation – particularly 300–500 mg kg −1 – improved growth performance relative to the AFB 1 group ( P &lt; 0.05). CUR also decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, alleviated hepatic histopathological damage, enhanced hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), and suppressed malondialdehyde accumulation ( P &lt; 0.01). At the molecular level, CUR upregulated Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes while downregulating NOD‐like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase‐1, and interleukin‐1β, indicating attenuation of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Dietary curcumin effectively mitigated AFB 1 ‐induced hepatotoxicity and performance loss in broilers through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

    "summary": "Aflatoxin B1, a mycotoxin commonly found in poorly stored poultry feed, damages broiler livers by triggering oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing weight gain and worsening feed conversion efficiency. This paper tested whether curcumin, a plant compound from turmeric with known antioxidant properties, could protect broilers from this toxin. Over 42 days, 720 broilers received either standard feed, feed contaminated with aflatoxin B1 at 1 milligram per kilogram, or contaminated feed supplemented with curcumin at 100, 300, or 500 milligrams per kilogram. Aflatoxin B1 alone reduced daily weight gain and increased the amount of feed needed per unit of growth; curcumin at 300–500 milligrams per kilogram reversed these effects. At the tissue level, curcumin lowered liver enzyme markers of damage, reduced scarring and cell death in liver tissue, boosted protective enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and reduced harmful oxidative byproducts. Molecularly, curcumin activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 antioxidant pathway and suppressed the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome—a cellular trigger for inflammatory cell death—by reducing caspase-1 and interleukin-1 beta.  Within contaminated feed systems, curcumin emerges as both a remedial intervention and a marker of deeper structural vulnerabilities. The same storage failures that generate aflatoxin B1 as a byproduct of mould growth in feed warehouses create the conditions requiring chemical mitigation; curcumin does not address the material conditions—moisture, temperature, ventilation—that allow toxin-producing moulds to proliferate in the first place. Rather, this paper documents how a natural additive can be layered into industrial poultry production to manage exposure without altering the infrastructural arrangements that make such exposure routine. The efficacy of curcumin thus depends on, and reinforces, a system where mycotoxin contamination is treated as an inevitable cost absorbed through supplementation rather than prevented through transformed storage practices.",

Cyclobutrifluram exhibits antifungal activity against <i>Fusarium</i> spp., yet its bioactivity and resistance risk against <i>F. solani</i> remain unclear. In this study, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of cyclobutrifluram against 155 <i>F. solani</i> strains ranged from 0.0279 to 0.1102 μg/mL, with a mean of 0.0513 ± 0.0170 μg/mL. Treatment with cyclobutrifluram significantly inhibited conidial production and germination, reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, increased hyphal branching, and shortened the distance between septa or cell nuclei. Cyclobutrifluram provided excellent control over PRR. Seven laboratory-generated cyclobutrifluram-resistant mutants showed no or slight fitness penalties and exhibited positive cross-resistance only with pydiflumetofen, indicating a moderate-to-high resistance risk.

    "summary": "This paper documents the antifungal potency of cyclobutrifluram against *Fusarium solani*, the fungus responsible for peanut root rot, across 155 field-collected strains. The drug inhibited spore production and germination, disrupted the fungus's energy metabolism by reducing succinate dehydrogenase activity, and altered hyphal structure by increasing branching and compressing the spacing between cell compartments. Cyclobutrifluram delivered effective disease control in peanut crops. However, the study identified a significant liability: seven laboratory-generated resistant mutants emerged without substantial fitness costs and showed cross-resistance to pydiflumetofen, signalling moderate-to-high risk of resistance development in field populations. Genetic analysis pinpointed four specific mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex that confer resistance, confirmed through molecular modelling and experimental gene replacement.  The tension embedded in this finding reflects a familiar pattern in agricultural chemical control: a potent tool for managing crop disease simultaneously creates the conditions for its own obsolescence. The same metabolic target that makes cyclobutrifluram effective—the succinate dehydrogenase complex—proves vulnerable to rapid genetic adaptation in *Fusarium solani*, with resistant mutants bearing no apparent survival cost. This decoupling of resistance from fitness penalty suggests that once resistance emerges in peanut fields, it will persist and spread unchecked, transforming cyclobutrifluram from a solution into a driver of fungal adaptation. The moderate-to-high resistance risk documented here reflects not a flaw in the molecule but a structural feature of intensive monoculture agriculture: the reliance on single-target fungicides in environments where fungal populations are large, genetically diverse, and under constant chemical pressure.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "summary": "Aspergillus fumigatus isolates collected in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2022 showed a rising prevalence of azole resistance, with 34 distinct genetic variants identified in the cyp51A gene. This paper examined how individual genetic variations and combinations of variations in this gene affect resistance to four azole antifungal drugs. The researchers used computer modelling to predict how amino acid changes would alter the structure of the Cyp51A protein, then introduced these mutations into laboratory strains using genetic editing technology and measured how resistant the resulting fungi were to azoles. Strains carrying multiple mutations together showed substantially higher resistance levels than unmutated strains, particularly to voriconazole and isavuconazole, though the most heavily mutated strain remained susceptible to itraconazole despite carrying the TR34 resistance marker.  The pattern documented here reveals how a pathogenic fungus generates pharmaceutical resistance not as a binary outcome but as a graduated response shaped by the specific combination of genetic changes present. The same mutations that render this organism clinically intractable in one drug context can leave it vulnerable in another, creating a fragmented landscape of therapeutic options that depends entirely on which particular mutations accumulate in which individual isolate.

In response to this trend, we developed an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography method, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous quantification of 15 mycotoxins from Fusarium (deoxynivalenol (DON), DON-3-glucoside (D3G), 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, HT-2 toxin, T-2 toxin), Alternaria (alternariol, alternariolmonomethylether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA)), and Aspergillus species (aflatoxin (AF) B1, B2, G1, G2, sterigmatocystin (STC), ochratoxin A) in plant-based meat, cheese, and fish substitutes.

This paper adapted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to simultaneously measure these toxins, which include deoxynivalenol and its derivatives, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and sterigmatocystin, among others. The method employed a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction approach followed by dispersive solid phase extraction for sample cleanup and stable isotope dilution analysis for quantification.

The expansion of plant-based protein markets creates new sites where fungal metabolites accumulate and require monitoring—yet the choice of which toxins to measure, and at what detection thresholds, reflects prior regulatory and commercial decisions rather than comprehensive microbial ecology.

    "excerpt": "The consumption of tea as a beverage is considerably increasing worldwide. However, some questions are raised about its safety, particularly regarding the potential contamination by mycotoxins. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the overall prevalence of mycotoxin contamination in different types of tea (black, green, dark, white and pu-erh), to compare the contamination rate between two periods (2000–2017 and 2018–2022), and to investigate the impact of country’s income on this contamination. Included studies were selected from Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar research databases, according to PRISMA guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using MecdCalc software. Concerning the analytical methods used for mycotoxin detection, 84.6% of included studies used HPLC and or LC–MS/MS.

The review compared contamination rates between two periods (2000–2017 and 2018–2022) and examined whether a country's income level influenced contamination prevalence.  Tea consumption is rising globally, yet the material pathway from leaf to cup carries multiple fungal metabolites whose presence reflects uneven exposure to contamination risk. The prevalence of deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A — compounds produced by field fungi during growth and storage — suggests that tea operates simultaneously as a commodity subject to post-harvest degradation and as a consumed substance whose safety depends on agricultural practices and infrastructure conditions that vary by region and economic capacity. This paper documents not merely a health concern but a material entanglement: the same drying, storage, and transport conditions that preserve tea's market value can also concentrate the metabolic byproducts of moulds, making contamination both a marker of where tea is grown and processed, and a consequence of how it moves through global supply chains.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Introduction Relapses occur in up to 40% of patients after prolonged courses of antifungal treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). The factors predisposing to relapse remain poorly defined. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of adults treated for ≥ 6 months with oral azoles for CPA. Patients who completed antifungal therapy and were deemed not to require further treatment were included. Demographic, clinical, radiological and serological data at treatment completion were collected. CPA relapse was defined as symptomatic and radiological deterioration leading to re‐initiation of antifungal therapy. Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analyses were used to identify predictors of relapse and mortality. Results Among 125 patients (56% male; mean age 61 years), median treatment duration was 36 months. Thirty‐two (26%) developed relapse; relapse rate at 1 year was 16%. Aspergillus sensitisation (specific IgE &gt; 0.35 IU/mL) and elevated Aspergillus ‐specific IgG (&gt; 40 mg/L) at treatment completion were independently associated with relapse ( p &lt; 0.05). No patient with IgG &lt; 40 mg/L relapsed. Underlying lung disease (COPD or prior tuberculosis), extent of radiological involvement, or treatment duration were not significantly associated with relapse or mortality. Conclusions Aspergillus sensitisation and persistently elevated Aspergillus ‐specific IgG at the end of antifungal therapy were independent predictors of CPA relapse. These parameters may reflect ongoing fungal airway burden and can help identify patients requiring extended or closer post‐treatment follow‐up.

Patients with elevated Aspergillus-specific IgG (above 40 milligrams per litre) at treatment completion had significantly higher relapse rates;  no patient with IgG below this threshold relapsed during follow-up. Aspergillus sensitisation, measured as specific IgE above 0.35 international units per millilitre, was also independently associated with relapse. Among the 125 patients (56 percent male, mean age 61 years) who completed at least six months of oral azole therapy, 32 (26 percent) experienced relapse, with a one-year relapse rate of 16 percent. Median treatment duration was 36 months. Underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or prior tuberculosis, the extent of radiological involvement, or the length of antifungal treatment were not significantly associated with relapse risk.  The persistent elevation of Aspergillus-specific antibodies after prolonged antifungal treatment suggests a duality in what these serological markers represent: they simultaneously indicate successful immune recognition of the fungus and ongoing fungal presence in the airway. Rather than signalling cure, these antibodies may reflect a material persistence—fungal material or metabolic byproducts continuing to circulate or colonise lung tissue despite months of drug exposure. This finding reveals how the same immunological response that protects against acute infection can become a marker of incomplete clearance, positioning certain patients in a state of precarious stability where relapse becomes not a random event but a predictable consequence of incomplete fungal elimination.",

Laboratory tests showed the compound was highly effective against the target fungus and demonstrated activity against other fungal pathogens. Trials in fruit and greenhouse settings confirmed robust control of gray mold, including strains that had already developed resistance to multiple classes of existing fungicides. The researchers used AlphaFold2 protein modeling and molecular docking to show that ipflufenoquin binds to a specific site on the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzyme, with binding strength correlating to fungal susceptibility. Gene expression analysis revealed that the compound suppresses the fungus's basic metabolic processes while triggering stress responses, including increased activity of detoxification and efflux transporter genes that may contribute to resistance mechanisms.  Yet the treatment revealed an ecological cost embedded in the strawberry production system: controlling *Botrytis cinerea* created space for less sensitive fungal genera including *Cladosporium* and *Rhizopus* to proliferate. This pattern—where a targeted fungicide simultaneously eliminates a threat and reshapes the microbial community toward species that escape the same chemical pressure—illustrates how agricultural interventions operate within entangled systems of pathogen, crop, and capital.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The substantial increase in fungal diseases, the limited availability of antifungal drugs, and rising resistance to existing treatments highlight the urgent need for developing novel antifungal drugs. Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4–16 μg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades.

The identification of this compound from a soil microorganism reflects a deeper material entanglement: the same soil ecosystems that harbour fungal pathogens also contain bacterial producers of antifungal metabolites, yet the extraction and development of such compounds depends on industrial cultivation and chemical isolation processes that abstract these organisms from their ecological context.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD ₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development. Collectively, this platform provides a robust, mechanism-informed system for antifungal discovery, with broad applicability to synthetic agents, natural products, and biocontrol metabolites. IMPORTANCE This study provides a perspective on developing strategies to manage fungal pathogens with implications for agriculture and food security. The effectiveness of current fungicides is increasingly limited by resistance, narrow target ranges, and environmental concerns.

The researchers deleted genes encoding known fungicide targets in the pathogen using homologous recombination, creating mutant strains with altered sensitivity profiles to existing fungicides. These mutants served as a diagnostic tool: screening a library of 2,704 small molecules against both wild-type and mutant strains revealed compounds that affected fungal growth through specific pathways. The study identified 8 compounds with activity linked to the osmotic signal transduction pathway—the cellular mechanism that allows fungi to sense and respond to water stress—several of which showed antifungal properties not previously documented. The platform detects active compounds by measuring changes in optical density at 600 nanometers, a standard measure of cell density and growth.  The dual logic of this approach—using genetic vulnerability to map chemical action—exposes a material tension in fungicide development. The same genetic deletions that make mutants sensitive to novel compounds also reveal why resistance emerges: fungi can survive by altering or abandoning specific pathways, a capacity that fungicides themselves select for under repeated application. The 8 newly identified compounds targeting osmotic signalling represent not a solution to resistance but a temporary advantage in an ongoing arms race shaped by agricultural intensification and monoculture. What this paper documents is not the discovery of a durable antifungal but rather the systematic production of knowledge about fungal vulnerability—knowledge that, once deployed in fields, will itself accelerate the evolution of tolerance in populations already stressed by the chemical and economic pressures of industrial grain production.",

Plant-derived ingredients serve as major protein sources in aquaculture feeds; however, the increasing use of insects as alternative nutrient sources introduces additional potential pathways for mycotoxin contamination. Strong evidence shows that exposure of fish to mycotoxins can negatively affect their health, leading to reduced growth, impaired immune response and reproductive disorders. However, knowledge of the effects of mycotoxins on farmed insects is still limited. Little is known about the insect metabolism of mycotoxins and their transfer to animal feed, which constitutes a weakness of safety assessments of insects as feed components.

Plant-based ingredients remain the primary protein source in fish farming, but the shift toward farmed insects as alternative protein introduces new contamination pathways.

However, the metabolism of mold toxins in farmed insects remains poorly understood, and data on how insects process and transfer these toxins to feed are sparse—a critical gap in evaluating insect-based feed safety. This review compiles measured mold toxin levels across plant materials, finished aquaculture feeds, and fish-derived food sources, summarizes documented effects of specific mold toxins on fish health, and identifies unresolved safety questions around insects as a protein ingredient.  The expansion of insect farming as a sustainable feed source reveals a material entanglement: the same shift toward \"modern\" ingredients designed to reduce pressure on wild fish stocks and plant agriculture simultaneously introduces a biological pathway—insect metabolism—that remains largely opaque to safety assessment. Mold toxins move through feed chains in ways that depend on the specific organism processing them; what an insect does with a toxin differs from what a plant does, yet this difference is unmeasured and unaccounted for in current safety frameworks.

Deletion of chsb1 led to reduced colony growth, impaired aerial hyphae formation, thinner cell walls and significant cell wall remodelling. In contrast, single disruptions of chsb2 or chsb3 caused mild phenotypes, while double disruption of these genes resulted in severe growth defects, complete loss of aerial hyphae, and abnormal septation.

Using targeted gene deletion, the researchers disrupted chsb1 (clade BI) alone and chsb2 with chsb3 together (clade BII), then observed the consequences for hyphal growth, cell wall structure, and stress tolerance. Deletion of chsb1 produced measurable defects: reduced colony expansion, loss of upright filament formation, thinner protective cell walls, and widespread reorganization of wall composition. Disruption of chsb2 or chsb3 individually caused only minor effects, but deleting both genes simultaneously triggered severe impairment—complete absence of upright filaments, abnormal cell division patterns, and substantial growth failure. Both deletion strains accumulated higher absolute amounts of chitin despite their structural and developmental problems.  The findings reveal how a single structural polymer—chitin—can be simultaneously overproduced and functionally compromised depending on which enzyme variants are absent. In Pleurotus, the loss of specific chitin synthase genes triggers compensatory chitin accumulation that fails to restore normal cell wall architecture or growth capacity, suggesting that quantity of material and quality of assembly are decoupled processes. This material entanglement—where a fungus produces more of a critical polymer yet becomes more fragile and developmentally arrested—mirrors broader patterns in the Patchy Anthropocene where organisms and their products become simultaneously more abundant and less functional under stress, revealing how metabolic responses to disruption can paradoxically intensify vulnerability rather than resolve it.",

However, the reason for the TLO gene expansion remains unclear, and the current study aimed to determine if reduction in the TLO family copy number affected virulence. In order to investigate this, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to generate two TLO-depleted mutants: one mutant retaining only TLO&#946;2 (CaTLO2) and the second mutant containing only TLO&#947;5 (CaTLO5). Both TLO-depleted mutants exhibited increased filamentous growth, increased susceptibility to specific stresses and reduced virulence in a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC).

    "summary": "Candida albicans possesses an unusually large family of TLO genes—10 to 15 copies—that produce variants of the Med2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Mediator. Previous work showed that complete loss of all TLO genes prevents the organism from forming hyphae (elongated filamentous structures) and increases sensitivity to environmental stress, but the evolutionary advantage of maintaining multiple copies remained unexplained. This study used genetic editing to create two mutants: one retaining only the TLOβ2 gene variant and another retaining only the TLOγ5 variant. Both depleted mutants showed increased filamentous growth in culture, heightened vulnerability to specific stresses, and reduced ability to cause infection in mice with oropharyngeal candidiasis (a fungal infection of the mouth and throat). In cell-based assays, the TLOγ5 mutant specifically showed impaired capacity to escape from immune cells called macrophages and reduced ability to invade oral skin cells. The researchers then tested whether adding back the TLOα1 gene variant—previously shown to restore normal growth in completely TLO-depleted strains—could restore disease-causing ability, though the abstract does not report the outcome of this complementation experiment.  The TLO gene expansion in Candida albicans appears to encode functional redundancy tied directly to pathogenic capacity: the same genetic duplication that allows the organism to maintain disease-causing ability under stress also constrains its ability to survive immune pressure and invade host tissues when copy number drops. The tension emerges not between pathogen and resource, but between genetic robustness and clinical vulnerability—a pattern shaped by the selective pressures of human mucosal colonization and the specific immunological barriers of oral epithelium.",

    "excerpt": "The filamentous actinomycete Actinoplanes missouriensis develops terminal sporangia on substrate mycelia via short sporangiophores. Each sporangium, surrounded by an outer envelope, contains a few hundred spores encapsulated by the sporangium matrix. In this study, we identified a spore surface-displayed protein, SspA, that is required for the structural strength of sporangia in A. missouriensis through suppressor screening using a spore release-deficient mutant. SspA has a sortase-dependent cell wall-localizing signal, and its mature part is predicted to be a putative intrinsically disordered protein. An sspA null mutant (&#916;sspA) strain formed sporangia, but the mutant sporangia were highly fragile and collapsed immediately to release spores when suspended in aquatic solutions. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the &#916;sspA sporangia did not mature normally; the electron-dense sporangium matrix was not observed in the peripheral region of each spore, and the outer envelope of some sporangia was damaged.

    "summary": "The filamentous bacterium Actinoplanes missouriensis produces terminal sporangia—spherical structures containing hundreds of spores held together by a matrix and outer envelope. This paper identifies a protein called SspA, displayed on the spore surface and anchored to the cell wall through a sortase-dependent mechanism, as essential for sporangium structural integrity. The mature form of SspA is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein, a type lacking fixed three-dimensional shape. When the gene encoding SspA was deleted, sporangia still formed but became mechanically fragile, collapsing immediately when exposed to aqueous solutions and releasing spores prematurely. Transmission electron microscopy showed that sporangia lacking SspA failed to mature properly: the electron-dense matrix material that normally surrounds individual spores in the peripheral region was absent, and the outer envelope of some sporangia was visibly damaged. Peptide-tagged versions of SspA produced in the mutant strain were detected on zoospore surfaces using the HiBiT detection system.  The structural failure of sporangia without SspA reveals a material dependency embedded in the life cycle of this bacterium. A single protein—disordered in structure yet precisely positioned on the spore surface—appears to mediate the cohesion between individual spores and the matrix that contains them, a function that becomes visible only through its absence. This arrangement exemplifies how microbial survival strategies depend on specific material assemblages: the sporangium envelope, matrix, and surface proteins form an integrated system where weakness in one component cascades into collective fragility, suggesting that the robustness of these bacterial structures emerges not from rigid architectural design but from distributed material interactions that can fail catastrophically when disrupted.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non- fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the β-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species. In contrast, the activity of triazoles and amphotericin B was variable, particularly against A. tanneri , A. calidoustus , and A. sydowii .

Non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounted for 77.1% of all isolates, with Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto representing only 22.9% of recovered organisms. Species identification success varied substantially by method: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry achieved identification in 43% of isolates, while polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region succeeded in over 88% of cases, the β-tubulin gene in 81%, and the calmodulin gene in 68%. The most common underlying conditions among infected patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%), with mortality of 7.5% overall but concentrated among patients with chronic granulomatous disease and those with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that olorofim demonstrated the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations across species, while triazoles and amphotericin B showed variable activity, particularly reduced effectiveness against Aspergillus tanneri, Aspergillus calidoustus, and Aspergillus sydowii.  Within damaged or immunologically compromised lung tissue—bronchiectatic airways, granulomatous lesions, sites of mycobacterial coinfection—the Aspergillus species composition shifts dramatically from the canonical fumigatus toward a diverse assemblage of lesser-known organisms that resist standard pharmaceutical interventions. This paper documents not merely a clinical inconvenience but a material reorganization of fungal dominance within specific human ecologies: the same immune-weakened bodies that enable fumigatus infection simultaneously select for and concentrate species whose reduced drug susceptibility transforms them into both a therapeutic problem and, potentially, a marker of deeper structural vulnerabilities in how antifungal treatment regimens are designed and deployed.",

It necessitates the rapid and sensitive methods for real-time detection of these compounds in food products. Conventional detection approaches are accurate, but their complexity, high cost and time consumption often create obstacles. The use of nanosensors, particularly those based on 2D-nanomaterials like phosphorene, are novel means for quick, sensitive, and low-cost detection of mycotoxins. Its tunable bandgap, high surface-to-volume ratio, and high electron mobility enables fast, sensitive, and low-cost detection of mycotoxins in real-food samples. Advances in synthesis and functionalization of phosphorene have improved its stability and integration into electrochemical, optical and field-effect transistor based sensors. Such phosphorene-based nanosensors exhibited exceptional low detection limits with improved selectivity for real-time monitoring of complex food products.

The source identifies mycotoxins—toxic compounds produced by fungi—as a persistent food safety problem requiring rapid, sensitive detection methods. Conventional detection approaches, while accurate, are complex, expensive, and time-consuming. This study examines phosphorene, a two-dimensional nanomaterial with a tunable bandgap, high surface-to-volume ratio, and high electron mobility, as the basis for faster and cheaper detection systems. Recent advances in phosphorene synthesis and chemical modification have improved its stability and enabled integration into electrochemical sensors, optical sensors, and field-effect transistor sensors. This paper reports that phosphorene-based nanosensors achieve exceptionally low detection limits with improved selectivity for monitoring mycotoxins in real food samples, positioning the technology as viable for on-site contamination monitoring.  The dual character of this technological development reflects broader patterns in food safety infrastructure under resource constraint. Phosphorene nanosensors promise to democratize mycotoxin detection—moving it from expensive laboratory facilities to on-site, low-cost monitoring—yet this same shift relocates detection capacity away from centralized oversight toward distributed, decentralized points in food supply chains. The material properties that make phosphorene effective (its sensitivity, its capacity to integrate with multiple sensor types) are the same properties that render it dependent on continued synthesis, functionalization, and maintenance; the promise of accessible detection thus entangles food producers and retailers in new technical dependencies and supply relationships.",

Nine feed samples were collected from several intensive farms located in Southern Italy and analyzed through a multi-methodological approach. A total of 35 molds were isolated and A. flavus turned out to be the most frequently species, representing nearly 46% (16/35), followed by A. niger and A. candidus, each at 11.43%.

    "summary": "This study examined nine pig feed samples from intensive farms in Southern Italy to determine whether feeds serve as a source of occupational exposure to toxigenic fungi and their toxic metabolites. Researchers isolated 35 mold colonies total, with *Aspergillus flavus* comprising 46 percent of isolates, followed by *Aspergillus niger* and *Aspergillus candidus* at 11.43 percent each. Of the 16 *Aspergillus flavus* strains recovered, half carried all five genes required for aflatoxin production, yet only four strains demonstrated actual aflatoxin-producing capacity when tested by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, with aflatoxin B1 levels ranging from 0.52 to 1030 micrograms per liter. Ochratoxin A appeared in all nine feed samples at a mean concentration of 33.6 micrograms per kilogram, while Fumonisin B1 was detected in 97 percent of samples at 247.1 micrograms per kilogram; only one sample contained Aflatoxin B1 at 5.84 micrograms per kilogram, a substance classified as carcinogenic to humans.  The presence of these toxigenic fungi and their metabolites in feed materials reveals a material pathway through which occupational hazard enters the farm workplace. The genetic capacity for toxin production does not guarantee actual toxin release—a gap illustrated by the discrepancy between strains carrying biosynthetic genes and those demonstrating measurable aflatoxin output—yet the feeds themselves remain contaminated with multiple mycotoxins regardless of their origin, creating a tangible exposure risk for workers handling these materials daily. Feed contamination thus operates simultaneously as an indicator of agricultural vulnerability to fungal colonization and as a mechanism through which workers become exposed to carcinogenic substances embedded in the routine materials of intensive animal production.",

The study found significant correlations between education levels and awareness of aflatoxin contamination, with higher education associated with reduced contamination levels. Aflatoxin levels were highest in the central region, a pattern linked to farmers' reliance on self-stored grains. Training on aflatoxin management showed significant impact, though the abstract does not specify the outcome measures.  Within Punjab's dairy sector, contamination emerges not as a uniform biological threat but as a stratified exposure shaped by material storage practices and educational access. The concentration of aflatoxins in the central region—tied to on-farm grain storage—reveals how economic constraints and agricultural infrastructure determine which populations encounter higher mycotoxin loads in their feed and milk. Education functions here as both a marker of awareness and a proxy for economic position: farmers with greater schooling possess resources to adopt safer storage methods and market engagement, while those dependent on self-stored grains face both the biological hazard and the structural conditions that produce it. The efficacy of training interventions suggests that contamination is not inevitable but rather contingent on knowledge and material capacity—a pattern that implicates broader patterns of rural inequality in how mycotoxin exposure is distributed across the region.",

No other fungal species tested produced gliotoxin under any of the culture conditions examined. Molecular networking and comparative genomics revealed that related fungal species produce distinct toxic metabolites instead: *Aspergillus flavus* produces aspirochlorine derivatives, while *Aspergillus terreus* produces aranotin-related compounds. This paper clarifies that gliotoxin production is restricted to *A. fumigatus* among the clinical isolates examined, while other *Aspergillus* species have evolved separate metabolic pathways for producing structurally related toxins.  The distribution of these species-specific toxins across clinical *Aspergillus* isolates reflects a material reality of hospital environments: the same genus of fungus circulating through medical settings produces different chemical weapons depending on which species colonizes a patient's lungs or wounds. Gliotoxin's restriction to *A. fumigatus* does not make the other species less clinically relevant—it redirects attention to their own toxic metabolites as equally important drivers of infection and tissue damage.

This paper used three computational approaches—quantum chemistry calculations, network analysis of biological targets, and molecular simulations—to understand how citrinin and its breakdown products harm kidney cells. The study identified 255 biological targets involved in kidney damage caused by these compounds, with particular emphasis on multiple pathways of programmed cell death. Four key proteins (TP53, MAPK1, MAPK3, and HSP90AA1) were found to bind stably with citrinin and its metabolites; molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) were the primary mechanism holding these protein-toxin complexes together.  The paper documents a dual material condition: the same mould metabolites that circulate through food systems as unregulated contaminants are simultaneously recognized as biochemically active agents capable of triggering cell death pathways in kidney tissue. The identification of specific protein targets and binding mechanisms reveals how toxicity operates not as a simple property of the compound itself, but as a relational outcome—dependent on which proteins the metabolite encounters within the body and under what conditions. This computational mapping of toxin-protein interactions effectively renders visible the material entanglement between food contamination, mould metabolism, and human cellular vulnerability, while the focus on metabolites (rather than the parent toxin alone) suggests that the kidney-damaging threat persists and transforms through biological processing rather than being neutralized.",

Analysis indicated that specific long non-coding RNA molecules, including one designated MSTRG.32635, may destabilize cellular balance by interfering with genes involved in calcium regulation.  The findings reveal how a feed contaminant generates reproductive harm not through direct toxicity alone but through a layered molecular network—one that couples microbial metabolite, genetic regulation, and cellular signaling in ways that render reproductive tissue vulnerable.

These challenges include sampling (spot urine, 24 h urine, plasma, serum etc.) and analytical issues (missing reference standards, matrix effects, protein adducts, recovery, limit of detection, stability during storage, etc.). Further critical aspects needed for biomarker interpretation and human health risk evaluation are a lack of data for several mycotoxins such as (a) health-based guidance values (b) long-term biomarkers, (c) reliable food intake data (d) toxicokinetic parameters in humans, for example clearance and transfer rates to urine or milk and (e) HBM guidance values.

This paper reviews recent biomonitoring studies and outlines what future research must address to produce reliable exposure data suitable for health risk assessment.  The tension documented here reflects a deeper entanglement: mycotoxins are simultaneously ubiquitous food contaminants and poorly characterized human exposures. The machinery for detecting them in human tissues exists but remains fragmented across incompatible methods and unstandardized protocols—a fragmentation that mirrors the patchy geography of mycotoxin contamination itself, where exposure varies sharply by food supply, storage conditions, and access to tested products.

The authors position probiotics as alternatives to synthetic chemical detoxifiers, though they acknowledge significant limitations: strain-specific effectiveness varies widely, clinical evidence in human populations remains sparse, and environmental conditions substantially affect whether probiotics perform as intended.  Within the material entanglements of industrial food production, probiotics emerge as both a solution and a symptom of deeper dependencies. These living organisms are enlisted to manage contamination caused by other living organisms—moulds that thrive in the same conditions of storage, transport, and economic pressure that make food systems vulnerable. The dual function attributed to probiotics here—preventing mould-derived toxins while also remediating their effects in human bodies—reveals how biological management strategies can obscure rather than resolve the structural conditions that enable mycotoxin contamination in the first place. What appears as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical intervention is simultaneously a technology that allows food systems organized around speed, storage, and profit to persist without fundamental restructuring.",

The researchers determined the three-dimensional structures of these compounds using spectroscopic methods, quantum chemical modelling of light absorption patterns, and X-ray crystallography. Nine of the isolated compounds demonstrated cell-damaging activity against human lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 7.3 to 79.3 micromolar. Seven compounds also inhibited the growth of six pathogenic bacterial species, with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 1.6 and 13.0 micrograms per millilitre.  The compounds emerge from a marine fungus that has been deliberately sourced and cultured for bioactive secondary metabolites — a deliberate extraction of chemical production from a nonhuman organism. Yet the same alkaloids that arrest human cancer cell division and suppress bacterial pathogens represent a form of fungal metabolic capacity shaped by the organism's own ecological pressures and chemical defences.

We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus ), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% ± 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1–2) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% ± 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3–5 (F1 92.1% ± 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately. Our results demonstrate that CNNs integrated with low-cost smartphone imaging can reliably classify mold species in routine diagnostics, outperforming human experts in many cases.

    "title": "GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide homeostasis and involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus . Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus ; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus . This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy",

    "summary": "Nitric oxide homeostasis in Aspergillus flavus is regulated by the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which this paper identifies as essential for controlling nitrogen oxide signaling in the fungus. When S-nitrosoglutathione reductase was deleted, nitric oxide accumulated to elevated levels and the fungus became hypersensitive to external nitric oxide stress. The deletion also disrupted the fungus's ability to manage reactive oxygen species, causing accumulation of these damaging molecules and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress. Across multiple developmental stages—spore germination, hyphal growth, and spore formation—S-nitrosoglutathione reductase deletion impaired fungal development, reduced growth rate, weakened the ability to form protective sclerotial structures, and notably decreased production of aflatoxin, the carcinogenic compound that makes Aspergillus flavus a major food safety hazard. The fungus also showed reduced capacity to infect crop kernels when S-nitrosoglutathione reductase was absent.  The dual role of nitric oxide emerges here as both constraint and opportunity: the same signaling pathway that the fungus requires for normal development and toxin production is simultaneously a point of vulnerability that could be exploited for control. This paper suggests that blocking components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway—specifically S-nitrosoglutathione reductase—could suppress aflatoxin biosynthesis without necessarily killing the organism outright, positioning chemical interference with fungal signaling as a potential food safety intervention. Yet this approach also reveals a deeper entanglement: controlling a pathogenic fungus through its own regulatory machinery means targeting the same molecular systems that govern its basic survival and reproduction, raising questions about whether such interventions remain stable or whether selective pressure might generate fungal variants that circumvent this constraint.",

These emerging mycotoxins are known to exert diverse in vitro toxic effects. Furthermore, they share relevant antimicrobial properties, which may affect intestinal microbiota and hence gut health, immunity and animal welfare, particularly in herbivorous species. Despite growing interest in small herbivorous pets such as rabbits and rodents, limited data are available on mycotoxin contamination in their commercial diets. This study aimed to develop and validate a reliable LC&#8211;MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of selected emerging mycotoxins&#8212;such as beauvericin (BEAU), enniatins (ENN A, A1, B, B1), and alternariol (AOH)&#8212;in rabbit and rodent feed. A total of 200 feed samples (100 each for rabbit and rodent feed) were randomly collected from pet shops and markets in Bangkok, Thailand.

The researchers used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify three classes of fungal toxins—beauvericin, enniatins (four variants), and alternariol—in rabbit and rodent diets. Half of rabbit feed samples and 39 percent of rodent feed samples contained at least one of these mycotoxins, with beauvericin appearing most frequently; 13.2 percent of rabbit feed and 8.2 percent of rodent feed showed simultaneous contamination with beauvericin and enniatins, while alternariol was absent from all samples. The method met validation standards for selectivity, linearity, recovery, and precision, offering a practical tool for quality monitoring.  These findings expose a material entanglement between pet food production and fungal metabolite accumulation in supply chains serving herbivorous animals with limited regulatory oversight. The selective vulnerability of rabbits and rodents—whose gut microbiota can be disrupted by these toxins—reveals how emerging mycotoxins operate simultaneously as unmonitored contaminants and as agents that reshape the internal ecology of captive herbivores, creating new dependencies on feed quality assurance systems that currently do not exist.

Our findings demonstrated that PA effectively inhibited the vegetative growth, conidiation and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production of <i>A. flavus</i>. In addition, we found that PA also suppressed the pathogenicity of <i>A. flavus</i> on peanut and maize seeds. The transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, oxidative stress, ergosterol biosynthesis, and the MAPK signalling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i>. Biochemical experiments further demonstrated that PA could destroy cell membrane integrity and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, eventually resulting in defects of development and AFB1 biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>.

Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a public health concern, especially in countries where rice is a staple food, due to its carcinogenic, acute, and chronic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentration levels of AFB1 in domestic (Iranian) rice samples. The presence and mean concentration of AFB1 in 70 Iranian rice samples collected from local markets in Tehran, Iran were measured using a competitive ELISA method. Furthermore, a health risk assessment was performed based on estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFB1 from rice consumption, margin of exposure (MOE), and liver cancer risk in Iranian children and adults. AFB1 was detected in 26 samples (37.1%) with the mean concentration levels of 1.86 ± 0.67 ng/g (ranges from 1.12 to 4.26); of these, 7 samples (26.9%) had values exceeding the limit set by European Union regulations (2 ng/g). Additionally, AFB1 contamination in no rice sample exceeded the maximum limit accepted by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation (5 ng/g). This study showed that the mean EDI of AFB1 was 9 and 3 ng/kg bw/day for children and adults, respectively. In addition, the mean MOEs for children and adults were 18 and 64, respectively, indicating a public health concern. In addition, the present study showed that the risks of liver cancer associated with rice consumption among Iranian children and adults were 0.13 and 0.04 cancer cases/year/per 10<sup>5</sup> people, respectively.

The margin of exposure—a ratio comparing safe exposure levels to actual intake—was 18 for children and 64 for adults, both indicating potential public health concern. Estimated liver cancer risk from rice consumption was 0.13 cases per year per 100,000 people in children and 0.04 cases per year per 100,000 people in adults.  This paper documents a material entanglement characteristic of food systems in developing economies: the same grain that provides nutritional security simultaneously carries a carcinogenic contaminant whose presence reflects prior exposures during cultivation, storage, and distribution. The regulatory gap between European Union limits and Iranian standards—a twofold difference—reveals how acceptable risk thresholds are negotiated through economic and political channels rather than biological necessity, leaving populations consuming rice as a dietary staple subject to differential protection depending on where safety standards are set. Children's higher estimated daily intake and lower margin of exposure expose the uneven distribution of hazard within households, where dietary staples concentrate exposure among those least able to avoid them.",

To date, the investigation of mycotoxins in teas and spices has become an important issue worldwide.

The samples were extracted using a QuEChERS-like (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe) approach and the targeted 55 mycotoxins in the tea and spice samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. The results identified various levels of positive mycotoxin contamination in the tea and spice samples, with a variety of mycotoxins identified.

    "summary": "Researchers tested 120 tea samples and 300 spice samples purchased from Bangkok markets for contamination by 55 different mycotoxins—toxic compounds produced by moulds. The samples included three types of tea (green, oolong, and black) and ten types of spices (black pepper, white pepper, cardamom, coriander seed, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder, nutmeg, star anise, and turmeric powder). Using a rapid extraction method followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, the researchers detected various mycotoxins across the samples at differing levels. All black pepper and cinnamon samples tested positive for mycotoxin contamination, while black tea samples showed no detectable contamination. Beauvericin, an emerging mycotoxin, was identified among the contaminants, though the abstract ends before reporting complete findings.  The selective contamination pattern across these commodities—universal in some spices, absent in others—reflects the material conditions of their production and trade rather than uniform exposure. Black pepper and cinnamon's consistent contamination suggests particular vulnerabilities in cultivation, drying, or storage that create conditions favourable to mould growth, while the absence of mycotoxins in black tea indicates that processing or sourcing practices can interrupt this pathway. These Bangkok market samples thus document how the same fungal metabolites operate simultaneously as health hazards for consumers and as indicators of labour conditions, agricultural stress, and post-harvest infrastructure—revealing how food safety emerges not as a universal standard but as a patchy outcome of specific material arrangements across supply chains.",

Aflatoxins and ochratoxin A dominated pasture contamination, while fumonisins and zearalenone were most prevalent in hay, haylage, and silage. The grass species Urochloa spp. accumulated the highest mycotoxin loads, particularly T-2 toxin, aflatoxins, and ochratoxin A. Seasonal variation was evident: ochratoxin A peaked in summer pastures while fumonisins were more common in winter. Mean aflatoxin levels in both pastures and conserved forages exceeded European Union maximum tolerance limits for animal feed. Multiple mycotoxins co-occurred in 70% of pasture samples and 34% of conserved forage samples, with aflatoxins combined with fumonisins, T-2 toxin, or ochratoxin A forming the most common contamination patterns.  The mycotoxin burden documented in this paper reveals how fungal metabolites become embedded in the material infrastructure of livestock production—pasture grasses and stored feed—across a region. Rather than appearing as discrete contaminants, these toxins accumulate as overlapping chemical assemblages shaped by seasonal moisture and storage conditions, creating simultaneous exposure pathways for grazing and confined animals. The detection of aflatoxins at levels exceeding regulatory thresholds across both fresh and processed forages indicates that contamination persists through preservation methods, suggesting that the economic pressures driving intensified forage production and storage in Brazilian agriculture may systematically distribute fungal toxins through feed chains in ways that current regulatory frameworks do not fully contain.",

This paper tested whether dietary supplements containing chromium bound to the amino acid methionine (Cr-Met) and selenium bound to methionine (Se-Met)—given separately or together alongside aflatoxin-contaminated feed at 2 milligrams of aflatoxins per kilogram—could reverse these effects. Mice receiving either Cr-Met or Se-Met showed marked recovery in growth rate, feed consumption, and immune markers (immunoglobulin levels), while oxidative stress indicators and liver damage decreased. Gene expression patterns revealed that aflatoxin exposure triggered overproduction of an inflammatory enzyme (inducible nitric oxide synthase) while suppressing a protective antioxidant enzyme (catalase); supplementation partially reversed these patterns.  Within contaminated food systems, the same mycotoxins that damage animal bodies and reduce agricultural productivity become sites where mineral supplements—themselves products of industrial extraction and processing—acquire economic and biological value as remediation inputs. The protective capacity of these organic mineral compounds does not eliminate the underlying dependency on contaminated feed chains; rather, it reveals how damage mitigation becomes a new market segment within systems that continue to generate the original harm. The mice's recovery through supplementation demonstrates a material entanglement where industrial agriculture's failure to prevent fungal contamination is offset by the addition of further industrial inputs, each layer of intervention reflecting deeper structural vulnerabilities in feed production and storage.",

Mechanistic investigation of compound 9 revealed that it suppresses the fungal enzyme urease, damages the cell membrane, and triggers accumulation of reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative damage to the fungal cells.  Within the turbulent ecology of marine fungal assemblages, this paper documents how a single organism produces metabolites that operate simultaneously as antimicrobial agents and as chemical tools for understanding fungal vulnerability. The compounds' capacity to work additively with established pharmaceuticals reveals not a simple antimicrobial property but a material entanglement: the same molecules that might serve as leads for drug development also expose the dependencies of clinical treatment regimes on combinations of agents, each targeting different cellular systems. The shift from single-compound screening to combined-effect drug pairing reflects how novel fungal metabolites become legible as resources only through their capacity to enhance existing pharmaceutical infrastructure — a pattern that mirrors broader dependencies within biomedical economies on the continuous discovery of natural products to sustain therapeutic efficacy.",

    "excerpt": "The forma specialis concept has been a cornerstone in <i>Fusarium</i> phytopathology for 85 years, classifying pathogens based on host specificity. However, its validity as a natural and practical framework has been increasingly questioned. In this study, we critically re-evaluate the forma specialis concept through an extensive survey of Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts from 23 provinces of China. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, morphological assessments, and pathogenicity tests on 659 strains isolated from 171 diseased samples, we identified 46 <i>Fusarium</i> species, including seven newly described taxa, and uncovered extensive cross-host pathogenicity, with up to 21 species associated with the same wilt disease. In addition, 57% of samples exhibited multiple species co-infections, revealing significant inconsistencies with the forma specialis framework. These findings challenge the long-standing paradigm of host specificity in <i>Fusarium</i> pathogens and advocate for a shift of perspective to a \"pathobiome\" framework, where disease dynamics are largely driven by community-level interactions rather than single-pathogen relationships. Applying these conceptual advances to Fusarium wilt research could fundamentally transform our comprehension of host-pathogen relationships and facilitate the development of more ecologically sustainable disease management approaches.",

The researchers surveyed Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts in 23 Chinese provinces, analyzing 659 strains from 171 diseased samples using genetic sequencing, morphological examination, and pathogenicity testing. They identified 46 Fusarium species, including seven previously unknown to science, and found that up to 21 different species could cause the same wilt disease on a single host. Critically, 57% of diseased samples contained multiple Fusarium species simultaneously, revealing that the assumption of one pathogen per disease—central to the forma specialis system—does not reflect what occurs in actual crop fields.  The paper proposes abandoning the single-pathogen model in favour of viewing Fusarium wilt as a \"pathobiome,\" where disease emerges from the collective activity of multiple fungal species rather than from host-specific relationships. This shift exposes a tension between the orderly taxonomic categories that have structured disease management for decades and the material reality of crop fields where multiple pathogenic species coexist, co-infect, and collectively drive disease dynamics. The discovery that the same fungal species can colonize unrelated crops, and that diseased plants routinely harbour multiple species, suggests that sustainable management cannot rely on identifying and controlling single pathogens—instead, it must account for the ecological assemblages that actually inhabit diseased plants.",

Mutant strains, including the knockout (∆pdc1), pdc1 point mutants (K258R and K258E) and complementary (∆pdc1.com) were constructed. The results showed that both Δpdc1 and K258R strains exhibited decreased conidiophore and conidia production and failed to generate sclerotia. The production of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was significantly increased in the Δpdc1 and K258R strains, while it decreased in the K258E strain. The results also indicate that pdc1 and its Ksucc are involved in the stress response and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Through GC-MS analysis, Δpdc1 was found to produce several significantly decreased compounds, including n-hexadecanoic acid, 2-bromotetradecane, and palmitic acid, among others. Additionally, different volatile metabolites, such as 1-iodo-decane, n, n-dimethyloctanamide and n, n-dimethyl-7-octynamide, were not detected in the Δpdc1 strain compared to WT and Δpdc1.com. HPLC results showed that the production of pyruvic acid, malic acid and succinic acid increased in both the Δpdc1 and K258R strains when compared to WT and Δpdc1.com strains. Comparative RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 3,817 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 1,913 up-regulated and 1,904 down-regulated genes in Δpdc1 vs. WT.

Researchers created fungal strains with the pyruvate decarboxylase gene deleted or modified at specific sites and compared their growth and chemical output to normal strains. Strains lacking the enzyme or carrying a particular amino acid substitution produced fewer spore-bearing structures and no survival sclerotia, yet paradoxically generated more aflatoxin B1—the carcinogenic toxin this fungus produces. Analysis of the chemical profiles showed that these mutant strains accumulated higher levels of pyruvic acid, malic acid, and succinic acid, while losing production of various fatty acids and volatile compounds detected in normal strains. Gene expression profiling identified nearly 3,800 genes with altered activity in the enzyme-deleted strain, with roughly equal numbers of genes turned up and down.  The findings expose a material entanglement within fungal metabolism: the same enzyme modification that blocks reproductive structures and metabolite diversity simultaneously amplifies toxin accumulation. This reveals how disruption to a single metabolic node can redistribute fungal resources—suppressing investment in spore production and structural compounds while channelling carbon toward aflatoxin biosynthesis. The pattern suggests that under the metabolic stress imposed by enzyme loss, the fungus shifts toward toxin production as an alternative output, a reallocation of biochemical capacity that could reshape both the fungus's ecological role and its hazard profile in agricultural systems where such mutations might arise.",

These proteins function as molecular switches within various signal transduction pathways by cycling between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. However, their specific functions in Aspergillus flavus remain largely unexplored. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizing 5S rRNA and tRNA-gRNA tandem arrays was developed, achieving over 95% single-gene and 75% double-gene editing efficiencies. Phenotypic and transcriptome analyses revealed significant functional redundancy between cdc42 and racA. In the mutants, conidia germination was markedly accelerated, with early germination driven by increased hydrolase activity and ATP levels. The loss of either cdc42 or racA resulted in reduced pathogenicity, compromised cell wall integrity, diminished aflatoxin production, and disrupted oxidative systems. These proteins regulate the generation of ROS through their interaction with NoxR, the regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase (Nox). Cdc42 and RacA exhibited opposing roles in fatty acid β-oxidation and pyruvate metabolism. The simultaneous loss of function in both genes is lethal, as evidenced by the inability of the ∆cdc42racAtetOn mutant to grow on plates lacking doxycycline.

This paper employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with over 95% efficiency for single-gene deletions and 75% for double-gene deletions to examine these proteins. The mutant strains showed accelerated spore germination driven by increased enzyme activity and energy production, while loss of either protein alone reduced the fungus's ability to cause infection, weakened cell wall structure, diminished aflatoxin output, and disrupted the fungus's oxidative defense systems. Both proteins regulate reactive oxygen species generation through interaction with the regulatory component of a key oxidative enzyme complex, and they play opposing roles in fatty acid breakdown and energy production pathways. Deletion of both genes simultaneously proved lethal, indicating functional overlap but also distinct essential contributions to survival.  The findings expose a material entanglement between fungal disease-causing ability and metabolic capacity: the same proteins that enable the fungus to produce aflatoxin—a carcinogenic secondary metabolite of agricultural and public health concern—also govern the cellular processes that sustain growth and energy production under stress. The dual lethality and metabolic antagonism documented here reveal that aflatoxin synthesis is not separable from the fungus's fundamental metabolism, but rather embedded within it. This suggests that targeting these regulatory proteins could disrupt both the fungus's pathogenic capacity and its survival, though any intervention strategy must contend with the fact that these proteins operate at the intersection of multiple essential cellular systems.",

We found that phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, viz., PRPS2 (PrsA) is regulated by VeA and involved in AICAR synthesis. Deletion of PRPS2 resulted in a significant 17% (μg/mg) reduction in AICAR production in the strain (p < 0.05), whereas its overexpression led to a statistically significant 1.2-fold increase in AICAR content (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we characterised the transcription factor MtfA, which inhibits the expression of PRPS2 gene and is negatively regulated by VeA. Further validation by yeast one-hybrid assay showed that MtfA directly regulated the PRPS2 gene, while AICAR was significantly increased in the mtfA deletion mutant. The above results indicate that the global regulator VeA negatively regulates the transcription factor MtfA, which in turn targets negatively regulating transcriptional levels of PRPS2 to mediate AICAR biosynthesis in F. solani.",

    "summary": "Fusarium solani produces acadesine (adenosine analogue AICAR), a compound in clinical trials for cardiovascular complications and leukaemia treatment. This paper identifies a regulatory pathway controlling acadesine biosynthesis: the global regulator VeA activates phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, an enzyme essential for the compound's production. Deletion of PRPS2 reduced acadesine levels by 17 percent, while overexpression increased production 1.2-fold. The paper further characterises MtfA, a transcription factor that suppresses PRPS2 expression and is itself inhibited by VeA; yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed direct binding between MtfA and the PRPS2 gene, and deletion of mtfA resulted in significantly elevated acadesine accumulation.  The regulatory architecture documented here reveals how a fungal metabolite with pharmaceutical value emerges not from inherent biosynthetic capacity alone, but from the tuning of transcriptional control. VeA's suppression of MtfA, which then releases inhibition of PRPS2, creates a metabolic state that favours acadesine accumulation — a finding that exposes the contingency of microbial chemistry on regulatory networks shaped by environmental and developmental signals. The same fungal strain that produces a clinical-stage therapeutic compound is simultaneously subject to genetic manipulation that intensifies or dampens that production, illustrating how the value of a fungal metabolite depends entirely on the engineered or selected state of its regulatory machinery.",
