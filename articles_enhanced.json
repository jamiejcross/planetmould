    "summary": "Observations of human-nonhuman interactions reveal that nonwoven fabric in surgical masks can undergo rapid degradation when exposed to specific endophytic fungi, such as Aspergillus bridgerii. In controlled laboratory settings, Aspergillus bridgerii colonization was found to accelerate the breakdown of nonwoven polypropylene fabric, potentially compromising the integrity of surgical masks. The degradation process was shown to be dependent on the presence of moisture and carbon dioxide, creating a microcosm that fosters fungal growth and accelerates fabric deterioration. This phenomenon highlights the complex interactions between industrial materials, environmental conditions, and microorganisms, underscoring the limitations of human design in anticipating and mitigating nonhuman responses to infrastructure. Multispecies assemblages involving fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms may play a crucial role in the degradation of human-made materials, challenging traditional notions of durability and lifespan.",

    "summary": "The investigation of indoor air quality reveals complex interactions between mold, air fresheners, and industrial materials. In one study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from air fresheners accelerated mold growth in controlled environments, suggesting a synergistic relationship between these two substances. Conversely, mold spores in water-damaged buildings have been shown to react with certain VOCs, producing toxic byproducts that compromise indoor air quality. Additionally, studies have highlighted the formation of secondary metabolites in mold cultures when exposed to industrial materials such as drywall and insulation. These findings underscore the intricate web of relationships between biotic and abiotic components in indoor air, where human-made substances can unexpectedly contribute to the proliferation of mold and other pathogenic organisms.   Research indicates that certain species of Aspergillus and Penicillium mold can degrade polyurethane foam, a common material used in furniture and insulation, releasing VOCs that foster further mold growth. Moreover, the interactions between fungi, bacteria, and industrial materials have led to the formation of novel toxins and mycotoxins in indoor environments. These outcomes attest to the unpredictable and often detrimental consequences of human-nonhuman interactions within built spaces.",

Observations of the postharvest environment revealed that Ligusticum jeholense essential oil exhibits antifungal properties against Alternaria alternata, a common tomato pathogen. The essential oil's efficacy was attributed to the presence of sesquiterpenes and phenolic compounds that disrupt fungal cell membrane integrity and inhibit mycotoxin production. Results indicate that the Ligusticum jeholense essential oil can effectively control Alternaria alternata growth and associated mycotoxin contamination in postharvest tomatoes, reducing crop losses and ensuring food safety.

In vitro experiments revealed that hyperglycemic conditions significantly increased the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to alternariol and DON. Specifically, the mycotoxins induced greater apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cells exposed to high glucose concentrations.

The resultant multispecies assemblages often include bacteria, which facilitate the degradation of industrial materials and the dissemination of toxins. These interactions have been found to compromise the structural integrity of built environments and pose health risks to human populations, particularly those with compromised immune systems, such as burn patients.  Furthermore, the breakdown of industrial materials by fungal and bacterial activities has been found to release hazardous substances into the environment, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These chemicals have been linked to respiratory and neurological disorders in human populations and may exacerbate invasive mold infections in burn patients.
