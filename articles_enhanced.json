    "summary": "This study examined the degradation of nonwoven fabric in surgical masks by the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii in a microcosm setting. The microcosm consisted of a controlled environment with specific temperature, humidity, and light conditions. The researchers evaluated the degradation of the fabric using scanning electron microscopy (scanning electron microscopy) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that Aspergillus bridgerii significantly degraded the nonwoven fabric in the microcosm, with the degradation rate increasing over time. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed morphological changes in the fabric, including the formation of holes and the breakdown of fibers. The FTIR spectra indicated changes in the chemical composition of the fabric, including the degradation of polypropylene and polyethylene components.   the capacity of Aspergillus bridgerii to degrade nonwoven fabric in surgical masks, a material commonly used in medical settings to prevent the transmission of pathogens. The degradation of this material by the fungus raises questions about the potential for Aspergillus bridgerii to also accumulate and metabolize diverse materials, including those used in medical equipment and infrastructure. The tension between the pathogenic potential of Aspergillus bridgerii and its capacity to degrade and accumulate materials underscores the complex and multifaceted relationships between humans, nonhumans, and the built environment in the Anthropocene.",

    "excerpt": "While traditionally the health impacts of the biotic and abiotic components of indoor air have been assumed to be independent, recent studies indicate the opposite, highlighting the need for a systematic evaluation of their interactions to provide a holistic assessment of the health impacts of indoor air. In this study, we assessed the toxicological relationship between a commonly found indoor mold species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and air fresheners, an emerging source of abiotic indoor air pollutants. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of mold and two air fresheners (Brands A and B) on A549 cells and then tested the effect of co-exposure to the two toxicants on various cellular responses. We also analyzed the chemical composition of the air fresheners using LC-MS. Our results show that both air fresheners were composed of several compounds that could inhibit mold growth and pose health risks to humans. Furthermore, the chemical composition and concentration of the air freshener solutions could influence the toxicological interactions. Overall, our study demonstrates the need for further research on these interactions for a comprehensive assessment of indoor air health impacts. The knowledge will also allow air freshener manufacturers to formulate products with minimal health impacts.",

In this study, a natural and eco-friendly strategy was developed using Ligusticum jeholense essential oil (LEO), extracted via optimized enzymatic-deep eutectic solvent microwave-assisted method (EDP-MAHD), which achieved a 3.38-fold higher yield than conventional extraction. GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC₅₀, 0.0718 μL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

Mycotoxins were isolated from 20 edible herbs and identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that mycotoxins were detected in 14 of the 20 herbs, with the highest concentrations found in herbs from China. The minimum detection limits for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and fumonisins were 0.01, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms per kilogram, respectively. The study found that Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy could be used to rapidly detect mycotoxins in edible herbs, but with lower sensitivity than ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The study suggests that the combination of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy could be used for the rapid detection and risk assessment of mycotoxins in edible herbs.  The findings of this study highlight the entanglement of human and nonhuman relations in the Anthropocene. On one hand, the detection of mycotoxins in edible herbs reveals the threat posed by these organisms to human health, particularly in regions such as China where mycotoxin contamination is a significant concern. On the other hand, the use of Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy as a rapid detection method also underscores the capacity of technologies to metabolize and adapt to external stresses, thereby revealing deeper dependencies between human and nonhuman systems.",

Alternariol and deoxynivalenol are mycotoxins produced by fungi, specifically Alternaria species and Fusarium species, respectively. The mycotoxins were tested on human colon cancer cells in vitro, with the cells exposed to varying concentrations of glucose to simulate hyperglycemic conditions. The study found that hyperglycemic conditions modulated the response of colon cancer cells to the mycotoxins, with increased glucose levels altering the expression of genes involved in cell survival and apoptosis. The results suggest that hyperglycemic conditions may influence the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to mycotoxins, potentially impacting the development and progression of colon cancer. The study's findings have implications for understanding the role of hyperglycemia in cancer development and the potential use of mycotoxins as therapeutic agents.  The capacity of fungi to produce mycotoxins like alternariol and deoxynivalenol creates a tension between the organisms' potential as pathogens and their potential as resources.

It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000 nM T-2 toxin for 48 and 72 h. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 h. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48 h.

However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Fusarium) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) (P < 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus, and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR34-mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type. Specifically, the genotypes TR34/L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole.  This research highlights the complex relationship between molecular dynamics simulations and the structure-function relationship of in vitro phenotype in the context of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between genetic mutations and azole susceptibility in this pathogen.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The substantial increase in fungal diseases, the limited availability of antifungal drugs, and rising resistance to existing treatments highlight the urgent need for developing novel antifungal drugs. Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4–16 μg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance. Natural products remain a proven source of antifungal agents, but few new scaffolds have been introduced in recent decades.

Three cuboidal CuS MNPs─undoped (CuS), iron-doped (Fe-CuS), and cerium-doped (Ce-CuS)─were foliarly applied to Fusarium-infected plants in a greenhouse study. Fe-CuS led to the highest Cu accumulation in leaves─15.7 and 158.4% higher than undoped CuS and Ce-CuS, respectively, likely due to its positive charge facilitating stronger electrostatic interactions and more efficient NPs uptake. Compared to the untreated control, the Fe-CuS foliar application resulted in a 487.7% increase in shoot biomass and a 36.8% reduction in wilt damage through activation of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling, indicating a dual role of CuS MNPs as both a micronutrient carrier and an immune stimulant. Importantly, copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) activation may link Cu homeostasis to stress-induced H2O2 production, indicating a novel mechanism for nanoparticle-enabled plant immunity.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development.

Fatty acid profiling showed elevated proportions of C16:0, C18:2, and C18:3 and a reduced C18:1 content. RT-qPCR indicated that McLipin expression peaked at 24 h under SSF, coinciding with upregulation of ACC, FAS, cME, and NADPH-generating genes.

While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non-fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates.

We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species.

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus. Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus. This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy for ",

    "summary": "This paper investigated the role of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in Aspergillus flavus, a fungus responsible for aflatoxin production. The researchers identified a gene encoding GSNOR in A. flavus and demonstrated its activity during various life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. They found that GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis, as its deletion resulted in elevated nitric oxide levels and sensitivity to exogenous nitric oxide stress. Additionally, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis, and attenuated virulence on kernels. Furthermore, the study found that GSNOR deletion significantly elevated mycelial reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species) levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. The findings indicate that GSNOR plays a crucial role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus.  The Patchy Anthropocene lens reveals a complex relationship between GSNOR and aflatoxin production. On one hand, GSNOR is essential for maintaining nitric oxide homeostasis and reactive oxygen species balance, which are critical for fungal development and pathogenicity. However, the deletion of GSNOR also resulted in reduced aflatoxin production, suggesting that GSNOR may also play a role in promoting aflatoxin biosynthesis. This paradox highlights the tension between the need to regulate NO and reactive oxygen species levels for fungal survival and the potential benefits of targeting these pathways for aflatoxin control.",
