    "summary": "Observations at the site of a waste management facility reveal that nonwoven fabric in surgical masks has undergone accelerated degradation due to the presence of endophytic fungi Aspergillus bridgerii. The microcosm-dependent degradation is facilitated by the unique microbial assemblage that thrives on the masks' industrial materials. The nonwoven fabric's open structure and chemical composition create a conducive environment for Aspergillus bridgerii to colonize and break down the polymer chains. The degradation process is accompanied by the release of volatile organic compounds and the formation of distinctive, colorless gelatinous layers on the surface of the fabric. This phenomenon demonstrates the capacity of microbial assemblages to interact with and transform industrial materials, exemplifying the complex, multispecies dynamics at play in the Anthropocene.",

In vitro experiments demonstrated that hyperglycemic conditions increased cell membrane permeability and triggered oxidative stress in colon cancer cells, amplifying the cytotoxic effects of these mycotoxins.

This irrigation method also significantly improved soil enzyme activities and altered ionic dynamics toward a more favorable balance. Moreover, MNBs enhanced soil bacterial diversity, enriched beneficial phyla such as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and modulated fungal genera including Alternaria and Fusarium, suggesting an improved rhizospheric microbiome.
