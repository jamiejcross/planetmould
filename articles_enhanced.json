    "summary": "Aspergillus bridgerii, an endophytic fungus, has been found to degrade nonwoven fabric in surgical masks at an accelerated rate. This degradation occurs through the breakdown of polyester fibers by fungal enzymes, resulting in the fragmentation of the fabric. The microbial activity is dependent on the presence of moisture and nutrients, indicating a microcosm-dependent degradation process. The accelerated degradation of surgical masks by Aspergillus bridgerii highlights the unforeseen consequences of human activities on nonhuman systems, where industrial materials are subject to microbial decomposition beyond their designed lifespan. The findings underscore the need to consider the complex interactions between fungal communities, industrial materials, and environmental conditions in the Anthropocene.",

    "summary": "Mold growth in indoor environments is a prevalent issue, often exacerbated by the use of air fresheners. Observations reveal that certain strains of mold exhibit increased virulence in the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by air fresheners. These VOCs facilitate the formation of mycotoxins, which in turn trigger a range of toxicological responses in nearby microorganisms and macroscale organisms. The interplay between mold, VOCs, and air fresheners exemplifies the complex dynamics of indoor air pollution, where multispecies interactions give rise to novel, unforeseen effects. Notably, the degradation of air freshener components by mold enzymes leads to the production of secondary metabolites that modify indoor air chemistry, creating a feedback loop that perpetuates the cycle of toxicity.",

The results indicate that the essential oil exhibits potent antifungal activity against A. alternata, with an inhibition zone diameter of 24.5 mm and a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2.5 μL/mL. The essential oil's mechanism of action involves the disruption of fungal cell membrane integrity and the inhibition of fungal growth by interfering with ergosterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, the essential oil also shows potential in controlling the production of mycotoxins, such as alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether, by A. alternata, thereby reducing the risk of mycotoxin contamination in tomatoes. The findings of this study suggest that Ligusticum jeholense essential oil could be a promising natural alternative for the control of postharvest fungal diseases and mycotoxin contamination in tomatoes.",

Conversely, hypoglycemic conditions appear to mitigate the effects of the mycotoxins, resulting in increased cell survival rates.

It can damage several organ systems, mainly by inhibiting protein synthesis, and is also likely to induce oxidative stress in cells. In this study, the adverse effects of T-2 toxin were investigated in magnetic three-dimensional hepatic cell cultures of chicken origin. Cultures were treated with 100, 500, and 1,000 nM T-2 toxin for 48 and 72 h. The metabolic activity of the cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. To investigate the changes in the oxidative homeostasis, the levels of MDA, HSP27, and 8-OHdG were measured. To monitor immune response, the concentrations of IL-6 and 8 were determined. The metabolic activity of the cells decreased after the toxin treatments, but this decrease was alleviated after 72 h. Both MDA and HSP27 levels were significantly diminished by T-2 toxin after 48 h. The concentration of 8-OHdG was reduced by 72 h exposure to 100 nM T-2 toxin.
