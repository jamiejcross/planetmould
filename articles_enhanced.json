This microorganism thrives within the fabric's microcosm, breaking down the polypropylene and polyethylene materials that comprise the masks. The resulting degradation compromises the masks' integrity, underscoring the unforeseen consequences of multispecies assemblages interacting with industrial materials. The presence of Aspergillus bridgerii also introduces a localized toxin, gliotoxin, which has been shown to exhibit antifungal and antibacterial properties. As a result, the mask's fabric becomes a site of environmental rupture, where fungal, bacterial, and industrial components intersect in unpredictable ways.",

In a study of mold growth and air freshener use in urban homes, it was observed that certain fungal species, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, exhibit accelerated growth rates in the presence of industrial air fresheners. This phenomenon is attributed to the synergistic effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air fresheners, which enhance the bioavailability of essential nutrients for mold colonies. Conversely, some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, have been found to degrade certain VOCs, thereby influencing mold growth patterns. These findings highlight the complex, non-linear relationships between industrial materials, microbial communities, and indoor air quality.",

The essential oil demonstrated strong antifungal activity, inhibiting A. alternata growth and reducing mycotoxin production by up to 85%. Studies revealed that the oil's antifungal mechanism involves the disruption of fungal cell membrane integrity, leading to increased permeability and ultimately, cell death. Furthermore, the oil's effective antifungal properties are attributed to the presence of sesquiterpene compounds, specifically ligustilide and butylphthalide, which exhibit strong inhibitory effects against A. alternata. The results suggest Ligusticum jeholense essential oil as a promising natural alternative for controlling postharvest fungal diseases and mycotoxin contamination in tomatoes, thereby ensuring food safety and reducing economic losses.",
