    "summary": "Observations indicate that nonwoven fabric in surgical masks is susceptible to degradation by endophytic fungi, specifically Aspergillus bridgerii. The microcosm-dependent degradation process reveals a complex multispecies assemblage where fungal mycelium interacts with the fabric's chemical composition, resulting in significant material breakdown. This degradation is accelerated in environments with elevated temperatures and humidity, exacerbating the fabric's disintegration. The breakdown products of the nonwoven fabric facilitate the proliferation of fungi and other microorganisms, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of degradation and growth. The findings underscore the capacity of microorganisms to exploit and modify industrial materials, ultimately reconfiguring the built environment through unanticipated processes.",

The results suggest that Ligusticum jeholense essential oil may be a viable natural alternative for controlling fungal growth in postharvest tomato storage.

    "summary": "In contaminated waterways, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalysts and nanozymes have been observed to interact with mycotoxins, breaking them down into their constituent parts at the nanoscale. This catalytic degradation was found to be accelerated by the presence of certain types of photocatalysts, primarily titanium dioxide (TiO2), which facilitated the breakdown of fungal toxins into smaller, less hazardous compounds. However, the introduction of these nanomaterials into aquatic ecosystems has been linked to unforeseen consequences, including the unintended mobilization of heavy metals and the promotion of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Furthermore, the interaction between PMS catalysts and certain types of fungi has resulted in the formation of novel nanocomposites, which exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and altered spectral signatures. These findings suggest that the deployment of nanomaterial-enabled catalytic degradation technologies in contaminated waterways may have far-reaching, and as yet unpredictable, consequences for the complex web of microbial and chemical interactions that underpin ecosystem functioning.",

Studies employing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) have demonstrated the efficacy of these techniques in screening and quantifying mycotoxins in a wide range of edible herbs.   UPLC-MS/MS allows for the rapid detection and quantification of mycotoxins, providing high sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. This technique has been applied to various edible herbs, including basil, parsley, and cilantro, with detection limits as low as 0.01 mg/kg.  In contrast, FT-NIR spectroscopy offers a rapid and non-destructive approach to screening edible herbs for mycotoxin contamination. This method relies on the unique vibrational frequencies of molecules to identify the presence of mycotoxins. The combination of UPLC-MS/MS and FT-NIR spectroscopy represents a valuable tool for the rapid detection and assessment of mycotoxin risk in edible herbs.",
