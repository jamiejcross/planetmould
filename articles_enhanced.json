    "title": "Microplastic-pathogen interactions differentially modulate tomato Fusarium wilt severity: The dependence of polymer biodegradability",
    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Hazardous Materials",
    "excerpt": "Microplastics (MPs) are pervasively present in agricultural soils, adversely affecting rhizosphere ecology and plant physiology; however, their influence on soil-borne pathogens and crop health remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of exogenous MPs on Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) colonization, virulence and antagonistic network in tomato rhizosphere using hydroponic, soil-based, and in vitro co-culture assays. We found that conventional polyethylene (PE) exacerbated wilt severity by 19 %, whereas biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) reduced it by 14 %. This divergence arose from MP-mediated pathogen colonization patterns: PE adhered to root surfaces and facilitated colonization, whereas PLA leachates generated during degradation suppressed growth. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro antifungal assays identified two key antifungal pathways: the intermediate L-lactide induced rhizosphere acidification, and the leached plasticizer tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, which exhibited direct antifungal activity (minimum inhibitory concentration = 50 mg·L-1; inhibition rate = 15.5 %). Transcriptomic profiling revealed that PE upregulated N transport and metabolism genes in FOL, whereas PLA downregulated the expression of the plant cell wall-degrading enzyme gene FOXG_11947 (log2 fold change = -3.18), reducing β-1,3-glucanase activity by 75.5 %, and consequently impairing pathogen virulence toward the host roots. Beyond singular interaction with FOL, PLA shifted rhizosphere microbiome toward an antagonistic network, which consequently reduced Fusarium abundance by 1.31 %. Our findings establish a polymer-dependent mechanism by which MPs regulate soil-borne disease and underscore an underappreciated co-exposure threat, providing a scientific basis for sustainable plastic use in agriculture.",

    "summary": "Microplastics in agricultural soil operate as dual agents in the pathogenic ecology of tomato wilt disease, their effects contingent on chemical composition and degradation pathways. This paper examined how conventional polyethylene and biodegradable polylactic acid microplastics influence the colonization and disease-causing ability of *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *lycopersici* in tomato roots using hydroponic systems, soil-based experiments, and controlled culture assays. Conventional polyethylene increased wilt severity by 19 percent through direct adhesion to root surfaces that enhanced pathogen colonization, whereas polylactic acid reduced severity by 14 percent via degradation byproducts: the compound L-lactide triggered soil acidification, and the leached plasticizer tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate demonstrated direct antifungal activity at concentrations of 50 milligrams per litre. At the molecular level, polylactic acid suppressed expression of the fungal cell wall-degrading enzyme gene FOXG_11947 by 3.18-fold, reducing the enzyme β-1,3-glucanase activity by 75.5 percent and impairing the pathogen's capacity to breach root tissue. The polylactic acid treatment also restructured the root zone microbial community toward counteracting interactions, reducing *Fusarium* abundance by 1.31 percent.  The divergent outcomes reveal how the same material category—microplastics—becomes either a vector for disease intensification or a source of pathogen suppression depending on its chemical stability and degradation profile. What emerges from this assemblage is not simply a choice between harmful and beneficial plastics, but rather an exposure landscape where agricultural reliance on synthetic polymers creates simultaneous risks and remediation pathways, both rooted in the material transformations of degradation itself—a condition that binds crop health, soil chemistry, and microbial networks into entangled dependencies on plastic's chemical fate.",

    "excerpt": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly toxic contaminant commonly found in foods, and its trace detection faces severe interference from complex matrices. To achieve efficient enrichment and rapid detection of AFB1, this study designed and synthesized a magnetic dual-functional monomer molecularly imprinted polymer (MMIP) with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and dummy templated ECC as the imprinting molecule. Through surface imprinting technology combined with methacrylic acid and styrene as dual functional monomers, an imprinted layer with specific recognition sites was constructed, while systematically optimizing synthesis conditions and adsorption-desorption parameters. The results demonstrated that the prepared MMIP exhibited high adsorption capacity (15.385 mg/g), rapid adsorption kinetics (reaching equilibrium within 2 min), good selectivity (imprinting factor of 2.40), large enrichment factor (23.8), and excellent reusability (only 6.1% decrease in adsorption efficiency after 10 cycles). Using this material as a MMIP-based magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction combined with UPLC-MS/MS, an analytical method for trace AFB1 in complex food matrices was established, showing a linear range of 0.005-50 μg/L, a detection limit of 0.002 μg/L, and recovery rates ranging from 86.13% to 113.44%. This study provides a reliable strategy for the highly selective enrichment and rapid detection of trace AFB1 in complex food matrices.",

This paper describes a magnetic polymer material engineered to selectively capture and concentrate aflatoxin B1 from food samples. The material combines magnetic nanoparticles as a core with an imprinted polymer layer constructed from methacrylic acid and styrene as dual functional monomers, designed to recognize aflatoxin B1 through surface imprinting technology. Testing demonstrated the material achieved high binding capacity (15.385 milligrams per gram), reached equilibrium binding within 2 minutes, showed selectivity with an imprinting factor of 2.40, concentrated the target compound 23.8-fold, and retained 93.9% of its binding efficiency after 10 reuse cycles. When deployed in a detection pipeline combining magnetic extraction with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, the method detected aflatoxin B1 across a range of 0.005 to 50 micrograms per litre, with a detection limit of 0.002 micrograms per litre and recovery rates between 86.13% and 113.44%.  The fungal toxin that triggers this technological intervention is simultaneously a marker of material vulnerability and a driver of material innovation. The same contamination that signals food spoilage, crop loss, and human exposure—patterns shaped by storage conditions, labour practices, and economic pressures on agricultural systems—also catalyzes the development of increasingly sophisticated capture and detection polymers. The rapid kinetics and reusability of this magnetic imprinted material reveal how hazard mitigation becomes embedded in manufactured surfaces, shifting the burden of managing fungal metabolites from prevention and remediation to engineered detection and sequestration within industrial food supply chains.",

This study evaluated the contamination status of 18 mycotoxins in 126 commercially available feline and canine foods collected from online and offline markets in China between 2021 and 2023, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).

Co-occurrence analysis showed that 95.89% of canine and 92.46% of feline foods contained two or more mycotoxins, and detection of six mycotoxins within a single product was most common (42.42% in canine food and 35.85% in feline food). Regression analysis indicated that lower retail prices and the inclusion of corn were associated with higher ZEN exceeding regulatory limit rates, whereas higher crude fiber content was inversely correlated with ZEN contamination.

    "summary": "This study examined 126 commercially available pet foods for cats and dogs purchased from Chinese markets between 2021 and 2023, testing for 18 different mycotoxins using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Eight mycotoxins were detected across the samples. Fumonisin B1 appeared in 97.26 percent of dog foods and 94.34 percent of cat foods, with mean concentrations of 886.1 to 903.88 micrograms per kilogram, while zearalenone was found in 95.89 percent of dog foods and 90.57 percent of cat foods at mean concentrations of 410.2 to 459.02 micrograms per kilogram. The majority of products contained multiple mycotoxins simultaneously—95.89 percent of dog foods and 92.46 percent of cat foods held two or more toxins, with six different mycotoxins detected in a single product most frequently (42.42 percent of dog foods and 35.85 percent of cat foods). Analysis revealed that lower retail prices and the presence of corn in formulations correlated with higher rates of zearalenone exceeding regulatory limits, while higher crude fiber content showed an inverse relationship with zearalenone contamination.  Within the material chains of pet food production and distribution in China, mycotoxin contamination emerges not simply as a failure of quality control but as a structured outcome of cost-cutting practices and ingredient sourcing. The correlation between price point and toxin load—where cheaper products accumulate higher contamination—reveals how economic pressures shape the biological composition of food destined for companion animals, with corn-based formulations becoming vectors for fungal metabolites. The widespread co-occurrence of multiple mycotoxins in single products suggests that remediation or substitution of one contaminated ingredient does not resolve the underlying vulnerability; rather, it points toward systemic dependencies on agricultural materials already compromised by storage conditions, transport, or pre-existing fungal colonization in supply chains that prioritize cost over safety monitoring.",

This paper analyzed 1,253 samples collected from export companies in Aydın province—838 samples in 2024 and 415 in 2025—using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. In 2024, 172 samples (50.2%) contained detectable aflatoxin ranging from 0.43 to 60.73 micrograms per kilogram; in 2025, 81 samples (19.5%) showed contamination between 0.87 and 40.08 micrograms per kilogram. Across both years, 253 samples contained measurable aflatoxin, with 29 exceeding European Union regulatory limits—representing 2.2% of 2024 samples and 2.7% of 2025 samples relative to the total tested.  The contamination pattern reveals a material entanglement between agricultural commodity production and regulatory compliance in a high-volume export system. Figs destined for European markets carry both the metabolic signature of mould activity in storage and the economic pressure to move product across borders; the toxin itself becomes a marker of where safety enforcement succeeds and where it fails, distributed unevenly across the supply chain. That nearly one-fifth to one-half of samples contain detectable aflatoxin—even as the fraction exceeding limits remains formally low—documents the routine presence of fungal toxins in a food commodity, normalized within acceptable thresholds yet persistent enough to require continuous monitoring and occasional rejection at the point of export.",

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identifies this navigation strategy as a distinct biological capability. Beyond the title and abstract provided, the source text does not contain specific data on the organisms tested, the surfaces studied, the experimental methods used, or quantitative measurements of the gliding behaviour or chiral properties.  Filamentous cyanobacteria—organisms that fundamentally altered planetary chemistry by producing oxygen and enabling complex life—operate as both ancient architects of habitability and contemporary navigators of surfaces. Their capacity to direct movement through chiral gliding reveals how even microscopic organisms develop precise spatial strategies, yet the mechanisms linking this navigation ability to survival under variable conditions remain unspecified in this summary. The tension between cyanobacteria as foundational planetary engineers and as active agents responding to immediate material constraints suggests a deeper entanglement: their movement across surfaces may reflect not merely evolutionary refinement but also adaptation to specific chemical or physical conditions that shape where and how they persist in contemporary ecosystems.",

    "excerpt": "Opportunistic fungal infections have become an increasing health threat, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, due to their high virulence, biofilm-forming capacity, and resistance to conventional antifungals. Given the limited therapeutic arsenal, drug repurposing represents a promising strategy for antifungal discovery. This study evaluated the antifungal activity and mechanisms of auranofin and iodoquinol against filamentous fungi listed as World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens, including <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>, <i>Scedosporium boydii</i>, <i>Lomentospora prolificans</i>, <i>Rhizopus oryzae</i>, <i>Mucor velutinosus</i>, and <i>Cunninghamella</i> sp. Although <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> is not included in the WHO priority list, it was included in this study due to its clinical relevance as a major cause of aspergillosis and fungal rhinosinusitis. Auranofin displayed fungicidal activity against <i>Aspergillus</i> spp., <i>L. prolificans</i>, <i>S. boydii</i>, and <i>R. oryzae</i>, while iodoquinol exhibited potent but mainly fungistatic effects, with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.625 to 20 µM. Both compounds inhibited early growth and reduced preformed biofilms by over 50% in biomass and metabolic activity. Stress susceptibility and fluorescence assays indicated that auranofin interferes with lipid homeostasis, cell wall integrity, and oxidative stress responses, whereas iodoquinol alters membrane lipids, mannose, and chitin distribution, suggesting multitarget surface effects. Scanning electron microscopy revealed consistent ultrastructural alterations, including hyphal deformation and increased extracellular matrix deposition in <i>A. fumigatus</i> and <i>F. oxysporum</i> treated with sub-inhibitory drug concentrations, corroborating the observed cellular stress responses.

Auranofin demonstrated fungicidal activity (killing fungi outright) against *Aspergillus* species, *L. prolificans*, *S. boydii*, and *R. oryzae*, while iodoquinol showed potent but primarily fungistatic effects (inhibiting growth without killing), with minimum inhibitory concentration values between 0.625 and 20 micromolar. Both compounds suppressed early fungal growth and reduced established surface-bound microbial communities by more than 50% in biomass and metabolic activity. Scanning electron microscopy documented consistent physical damage to fungal cells, including deformation of hyphal filaments and increased extracellular matrix deposition in *A. fumigatus* and *F. oxysporum* at sub-lethal drug doses. The two drugs operated through distinct but overlapping mechanisms: auranofin disrupted lipid balance, cell wall integrity, and oxidative stress defenses, while iodoquinol altered the distribution of membrane lipids, mannose, and chitin across the fungal cell surface.  Within contexts of limited antifungal options and rising drug resistance, this paper documents how existing pharmaceutical compounds—originally developed for unrelated clinical purposes—can be redirected toward opportunistic fungal pathogens. The dual mechanisms of action and surface-bound microbial communities-disrupting capacity reveal how a single compound can simultaneously target multiple vulnerabilities in fungal physiology, yet the distinction between fungicidal and fungistatic effects suggests that the therapeutic utility of these repurposed drugs will depend on host immune status and infection site, embedding their efficacy within the variable biological and social conditions of immune-weakened populations where such infections concentrate.",

The morphological similarities that make *Aspergillus* species difficult to distinguish by eye—the very feature that has historically demanded expert time and interpretive skill—become legible to the machine vision system through standardized staining and magnification. Yet the system's reliability depends on human gatekeeping: the quality control process that excluded over 300 images demonstrates that even high-resolution microscopy produces material variation that requires expert judgment to filter. The speed gain for laboratories thus rests on a prior labour of curation, suggesting that automation in clinical mycology does not eliminate human expertise but rather redistributes it, concentrating interpretive work upstream in image preparation and validation rather than downstream in species identification.",

However, considering then increasing prevalence of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the diet of dairy cows, concerns arise regarding the possible contamination of milk and dairy products with AFM1, the major metabolite of AFB1 excreted in the milk of lactating animals. AFM1, although less potent when compared to AFB1, has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of human hepatic carcinoma. Hence, following a survey on AFM1 contamination of raw and processed drinking milk, this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in yogurt available in Bangkok, Thailand, and to estimate the associated dietary exposure and health risk among different population groups. A total of 180 plain yogurt samples were randomly collected from supermarkets during March to June 2024. The samples were extracted using the QuEChERS methodology and analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry method.

    "summary": "Raw milk consumed by dairy cattle becomes contaminated with Aflatoxin B1, a mould metabolite produced in feed. When lactating animals consume contaminated feed, they excrete AFM1—the primary metabolite of AFB1—into their milk. This paper surveyed yogurt samples collected from Bangkok supermarkets between March and June 2024, analysing 180 plain yogurt products using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect residual AFM1. The analysis found AFM1 in 12 of the 180 samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.031 to 0.048 micrograms per kilogram. Although AFM1 is less toxic than its parent compound AFB1, it has been linked to increased rates of liver cancer in humans, prompting the researchers to assess dietary exposure and health risk across different population groups in Thailand.  Within the food system documented here, yogurt emerges as a site where agricultural contamination—originating in animal feed—becomes embedded in a processed dairy product destined for human consumption. The detection of AFM1 in supermarket yogurt reveals how mould metabolites travel through commodity chains and accumulate in bodies via everyday consumption. Rather than a simple contamination event, this pattern reflects the material dependencies of industrial dairy production: the feed sourcing practices, storage conditions, and regulatory gaps that allow AFB1-producing moulds to persist upstream, only to reappear as AFM1 in the finished product on retail shelves. The health risk assessment becomes a measure not only of individual exposure but of structural vulnerabilities embedded in how milk is produced, processed, and distributed across Thailand.",

    "summary": "This systematic review examined scientific literature published between January 2004 and July 2024 to assess aflatoxin contamination and control efforts in Mozambique. Of 735 articles screened, 68 met inclusion criteria for analysis. The review documents that aflatoxin contamination remains widespread across the country, driven primarily by the use of maize, cassava, and groundnuts—all crops susceptible to contamination by toxin-producing moulds. Four species from the Aspergillus section Flavi have been identified in Mozambique: Aspergillus flavus (both large and small morphotypes), Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus tamarii. Additionally, three further species—Aspergillus texensis, Aspergillus toxicus, and Aspergillus minisclerotigenes—have been detected but lack detailed study. This paper notes that research into control strategies has expanded over the two decades examined, yet contamination levels remain high, and the absence of in-depth investigation into lesser-studied species threatens the effectiveness of biological control programmes.  The research reveals a material entanglement between agricultural staples and public health vulnerability in Mozambique. The same crops that sustain food security and trade—maize, cassava, groundnuts—are also the sites where toxin-producing moulds establish themselves, creating a dependency on control measures that remain incomplete. The identification of multiple Aspergillus species, some still poorly characterized, exposes a gap between scientific documentation and practical intervention: moulds circulate through crop value chains faster than knowledge about their behaviour accumulates, leaving biological control efforts operating with incomplete information about the organisms they aim to suppress.",

    "summary": "Zizania (Job's tears) crops show consistent contamination with zearalenone across field and market stages, according to this longitudinal study spanning 2021 and 2023-2024. The fungal genus Fusarium Gibberella Species Complex was identified as the primary source of zearalenone in 273 isolated fungal strains. Zearalenone appeared in 100 percent of field samples in both 2021 (121 samples) and 2024 (306 samples), with higher concentrations detected in the husk-bran mixture than in polished seeds. Detection of Aspergillus species and aflatoxin B1 in polished seeds indicated contamination occurring during crop growth rather than after harvest. The study identified 29 distinct mycotoxins across samples, with widespread patterns of multiple toxins co-occurring in single samples—including zearalenone combined with beauvericin, zearalenone combined with stemphyltoxin, and aflatoxin B1 combined with zearalenone and stemphyltoxin. Risk assessment indicated potential health hazards from zearalenone and aflatoxins for people consuming edible coix products.  The contamination patterns documented here reveal how a single crop variety becomes a site where multiple fungal metabolites accumulate and persist through processing stages. The movement of toxins from field to market—and the differential concentration in different seed fractions—demonstrates how the material processing of food (the separation of husk from polished seed) does not eliminate exposure but rather redistributes risk across supply chains and consumer populations. The persistent detection of zearalenone across all samples and years, alongside the emergence of multiple co-contaminating toxins, suggests that dietary exposure to these fungal compounds is not incidental but structural to the production and consumption of this crop under current conditions.",

    "summary": "This paper describes a magnetic-controlled detection system for identifying aflatoxin B1, a toxic compound produced by moulds, in food samples at extremely low concentrations. The device uses nanochannels—microscopic passages in a material—combined with ferrofluids (liquids containing suspended magnetic particles) to physically separate the recognition step (where aflatoxin B1 binds to a detector) from the measurement step. This separation reduces interference from other compounds naturally present in complex food matrices. The system combines two signal amplification methods: exonuclease III-assisted target recycling, which reuses the detected aflatoxin B1 molecule multiple times to generate stronger signals, and hybridization chain reaction amplification, which builds extended chains of genetic material to further boost detection output. The method achieved detection of aflatoxin B1 across a wide concentration range (10⁻⁵ to 10² picograms per millilitre) with a minimum detectable level of 4 × 10⁻⁶ picograms per millilitre, and demonstrated strong selectivity and resistance to interference from other food components.  Within the material entanglements of food safety monitoring, this paper positions aflatoxin B1 detection as a technical problem solvable through increasingly sophisticated biosensor engineering—yet the toxin itself remains a byproduct of moulds thriving in the very agricultural and storage conditions that capital and austerity have normalized. The nanochannel-gated amplification strategy treats the mould metabolite as a discrete target to be isolated and measured with precision, but this isolation obscures the broader ecological and economic conditions that allow aflatoxin-producing moulds to proliferate in stored grains and processed foods, particularly in regions where grain storage infrastructure reflects historical patterns of underinvestment and labour precarity.",

    "excerpt": "Current diagnostic approaches for mucormycosis are often limited by low sensitivity and prolonged turnaround times, which result in delayed treatment and poor clinical outcomes. We developed a novel diagnostic method utilizing a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of mucormycosis. The assay incorporates specifically designed primers capable of detecting as low as 0.001 picograms (pg) of spiked genomic DNA from Mucorales fungi. This LAMP assay demonstrated a high sensitivity of 98% and a 100% specificity of detecting fungal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples collected from mice infected with Mucorales fungi (<i>n</i> = 48) or from an uninfected control group (<i>n</i> = 15). To align the assay with clinical antifungal therapy, a subset of infected mice was treated with either liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) or a combination of LAMB and a humanized monoclonal antibody (VX-01) targeting the Mucorales-specific surface protein CotH3. Consistent with the treatment efficacy, the LAMP assay detected significantly lower fungal burdens in BAL samples from mice receiving the combination therapy compared to those treated with LAMB alone or placebo. Further validation was conducted using BAL samples from patients diagnosed with mucormycosis (<i>n</i> = 24) or aspergillosis (<i>n</i> = 17). The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 94%. These findings highlight the diagnostic potential of this LAMP-based assay as a point-of-care. Its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid turnaround time position this assay as a promising tool for early and accurate detection of mucormycosis, with the potential to improve patient management and clinical outcomes.IMPORTANCEMucormycosis is a rapidly progressive and fatal fungal infection.

    "summary": "This paper describes a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay designed to detect Mucorales fungi from respiratory samples. The assay uses specially designed genetic primers to identify fungal ribosomal DNA and achieved detection sensitivity down to 0.001 picograms of fungal genetic material. In mouse models, the assay demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity when applied to respiratory lavage samples from infected animals (n = 48) and uninfected controls (n = 15). When tested on clinical samples from human patients, the assay achieved 79% sensitivity and 94% specificity in distinguishing mucormycosis (n = 24) from aspergillosis (n = 17). The assay also tracked treatment response, showing reduced fungal detection in respiratory samples from mice treated with combination therapy (liposomal amphotericin B plus a humanized antibody targeting the fungal surface protein CotH3) compared to single-agent treatment or placebo.  The diagnostic gap this paper addresses—the delay between symptom onset and confirmed diagnosis—sits at the intersection of clinical urgency and material constraint. Mucormycosis progresses rapidly, yet current diagnostic methods are slow enough that treatment initiation often precedes confirmation, creating a bind where empirical therapy must proceed without reliable evidence of infection. This assay compresses that diagnostic window by shifting from culture-dependent methods to genetic detection, but the gap between mouse model performance (98% sensitivity) and clinical performance (79% sensitivity) reveals how laboratory-optimized detection encounters the material messiness of human respiratory samples and the variable fungal burdens associated with active disease. The assay's capacity to track treatment response in animal models suggests potential utility not just for diagnosis but for monitoring whether antifungal interventions are reducing fungal load—a capacity that could reshape how clinicians assess whether a chosen therapy is working before clinical deterioration becomes visible.",

    "summary": "Alkaline soils with pH between 7.9 and 8.5 restrict plant growth by locking nutrients into forms plants cannot absorb. This paper tested two bacterial strains—Pseudomonas sp. (VITK-1) and Burkholderia sp. (VITK-3)—applied singly and together to tomato seedlings grown in alkaline soil. Laboratory tests showed both strains could dissolve locked nutrients, produce enzymes that break down organic matter, and suppress two major tomato pathogens (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici and Ralstonia solanacearum) with counteracting activity ranging from 35.7 to 76.5 percent. When grown in alkaline soil, seedlings treated with the bacterial consortium showed germination rates of 73.3 percent and improved root and shoot development compared to untreated controls. The consortium also increased protein levels by 54.5 percent, proline (a stress-protective compound) by 69.5 percent, antioxidant activity by 50.7 percent, phenolic compounds by 60.9 percent, and flavonoid content by 52.5 percent.  Within the material entanglement of alkaline soil, these bacteria operate simultaneously as nutrient mobilizers and disease suppressors—organisms that solve the immediate problem of nutrient scarcity while also controlling pathogens that exploit stressed plants. The consortium's capacity to alter chemical conditions in the root zone and trigger protective compound accumulation in the seedling reveals how microbial activity becomes embedded in the plant's own stress response. What emerges is not simply a more vigorous plant, but a plant-bacterial assemblage whose productivity depends on sustained microbial presence—a dependency that reflects broader patterns of agricultural intensification where soil degradation (alkalinity, pathogen pressure) is managed through the controlled introduction of living organisms rather than remedied at its source.",

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: mBio: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Asexual reproduction in filamentous fungi is a common, efficient, and fast differentiation process for producing large numbers of asexual spores (conidia), which can be distributed through the air to colonize new environments. The whole process is tightly controlled by specific regulatory proteins. Among the major regulators is the zinc cluster protein of SclB (sclerotia-like B), known to influence various aspects of asexual growth and secondary metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans as well as other filamentous fungi. Two different growth conditions of A. nidulans were compared to obtain a mechanistic overview of the role of SclB, mainly during the transition of the fungus from vegetative to asexual growth. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) was coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and combined with transcriptomic analyses (RNA-seq). SclB coordinates this developmental shift mainly by controlling the expression of genes encoding a few, however, prominent regulators of conidiation. These include the transcription factors BrlA, VelB, and SclB and the pheromone oxygenase PpoC. Association of SclB to promoter regions requires the newly identified putative SclB response element with a nine-base-pair DNA motif. Scl2 is the corresponding protein in the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae and partially complements the A. nidulans Δ sclB asexual deficiency. This supports a partial functional complementation of this regulator among different fungal species. In summary, SclB coordinates the transition from vegetative growth to asexual reproduction in A. nidulans through in vivo transcriptional control over genes coding for established players of conidia formation. IMPORTANCE Fungi constantly adapt to environmental changes in their various habitats. Asexual spore formation allows for quickly leaving an unfriendly habitat through dispersal into the air.

    "summary": "This paper documents how the regulatory protein SclB orchestrates the developmental shift in Aspergillus nidulans from vegetative growth to asexual spore formation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing and gene-expression analysis analysis, the researchers identified that SclB controls this transition by regulating the expression of key developmental genes, including transcription factors BrlA and VelB, another copy of SclB itself, and the pheromone oxygenase PpoC. The protein binds to promoter regions through a newly identified nine-base-pair DNA motif. A related protein called Scl2 in the plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae partially restores asexual reproduction capacity in Aspergillus nidulans mutants lacking SclB, indicating functional conservation of this regulatory mechanism across different fungal species.  The capacity of SclB to govern rapid asexual spore production—enabling fungi to disperse through air and colonize new environments—reveals the material entanglement between fungal development and habitat instability. What this paper documents as a regulatory mechanism for adaptive reproduction is simultaneously a mechanism for rapid proliferation and dispersal under stress; the same developmental shift that allows escape from unfavourable conditions also enables the establishment of fungal populations in new locations, including those shaped by human activity, labour conditions, and infrastructure. The conservation of this regulatory logic across pathogenic and non-pathogenic species suggests that the capacity to transition quickly into spore-producing mode is a distributed fungal strategy for navigating turbulent ecological and economic landscapes.",

The synthetic community consisted of Trichoderma harzianum T19, a fungus, and Bacillus rugosus PM16, a bacterium. When applied to wheat plants infected with Fusarium pseudograminearum (the fungus causing wheat crown rot), the two-organism community suppressed disease symptoms and increased plant biomass, chlorophyll content, and yield-related traits. The researchers used full-length genetic sequencing of soil microbes to track how the synthetic community altered the existing microbial populations in the root zone—the soil zone around plant roots—observing enrichment of beneficial fungi like Mortierella and reduction of disease-associated fungi. Chemical analysis of root-zone soil revealed accumulation of metabolites linked to plant growth and disease defense, suggesting that the two introduced organisms triggered coordinated shifts in both microbial composition and chemical conditions.  The findings reveal a material entanglement characteristic of contemporary agriculture: the same fungal genus (Trichoderma) that can be weaponized as a biocontrol agent depends on co-introduction with bacterial partners to restructure soil communities in ways that benefit crop productivity. The disease suppression and growth promotion do not emerge from the two organisms alone but from their capacity to reorder the existing microbial landscape—enriching some taxa while excluding others—thereby creating conditions of simultaneous pathogen suppression and nutrient mobilization. This coordinated remodeling exposes how crop health under industrial pressure increasingly relies on deliberate microbial engineering rather than ecological resilience, binding agricultural productivity to the continued management and monitoring of introduced microbial assemblages.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultured only Klebsiella aerogenes, yet fluorescent staining hinted at fungal material through the presence of aseptate hyphae.

The polymicrobial assemblage documented here—where moulds capable of rapid tissue invasion coexist with viruses in the damaged lungs of a chemotherapy-treated patient—reflects the material entanglement of therapeutic intervention and pathogenic opportunity. The same chemotherapy regimen that targets malignant cells creates the immunological void in which multiple fungal and viral species establish simultaneous residence; the diagnostic technology that finally renders these organisms visible arrives too late to alter the trajectory already set by prior treatment decisions and the patient's exhausted immune system.",

    "excerpt": "While the hepatotoxicity of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) is well characterized, its immunotoxicity remains overlooked. This study investigates whether cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a bioactive polyphenolic flavonoid, can alleviate AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced immunotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that C3G significantly ameliorated AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced splenic injury, which was associated with the suppression of the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway and reduced expression of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, C3G modulated the gut microbiota by enriching specific beneficial bacteria (e.g., Alistipes and Candidatus Saccharimonas) and reversed AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced metabolic disorders. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from C3G-pretreated donor mice reproduced the protective effect of C3G in mice exposed to AFB<sub>1</sub>, whereas sterile fecal filtrate transplantation only offered partial relief, indicating that the core mechanism depends on viable microbiota. In summary, C3G alleviates AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced splenic injury by restructuring the dysbiotic gut microbiota into a more enriched community. This remodeling restores metabolic homeostasis and inhibits NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis via the gut-spleen axis. Our findings provide the first demonstration that C3G alleviates AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced splenic immunotoxicity by remodeling the gut microbiota via the gut-spleen axis, establishing a novel microbiota-dependent strategy mediated by natural polyphenols.",

    "summary": "Aflatoxin B1, a mycotoxin produced by moulds, damages the spleen through a mechanism involving programmed inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) triggered by the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome complex. This paper demonstrates that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, a plant-derived polyphenol, protects against this splenic injury by blocking the NOD-like receptor protein 3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway and reducing production of inflammatory signalling molecules (interleukin-1-beta and interleukin-18). The protective effect correlates with restructuring of the gut microbial community, specifically enrichment of bacterial taxa including Alistipes and Candidatus Saccharimonas, alongside reversal of metabolic disruption caused by aflatoxin B1 exposure. Transplantation of intact microbial communities from treated mice reproduced protection, whereas sterilized microbial filtrates provided only partial relief, establishing that viable bacteria—not their metabolic byproducts alone—drive the protective mechanism.  The findings reveal a material entanglement between a fungal toxin, a plant compound, and microbial communities that operates across anatomical distance through the gut-spleen axis. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside does not neutralize aflatoxin B1 directly but instead restructures the microbial ecology that mediates immune tolerance, transforming a dysbiotic state into one capable of metabolic homeostasis. This points to how exposure to mycotoxins—distributed unevenly across food systems shaped by agricultural practices and storage conditions—creates differential vulnerabilities that can be addressed not through toxin elimination alone but through microbial remodelling, a strategy that depends on access to specific plant-derived compounds and the capacity of individual microbiota to respond.",

Treatment with doxycycline and voriconazole, selected on the basis of these findings, resulted in full recovery. This paper documents an exceptionally rare co-infection and demonstrates the diagnostic utility of molecular sequencing in identifying multiple pathogens in severe lung infection.  The concurrent presence of a bacterial pathogen transmitted through poultry and a fungal pathogen in a single patient reveals how occupational or domestic exposure to animal reservoirs can create conditions for polymicrobial infection in the lungs. The rarity of this particular combination—and the initial failure of empirical treatment—suggests that standard clinical protocols do not account for such entanglements, leaving patients vulnerable until molecular methods expose the full microbial assemblage at work. The recovery achieved through targeted therapy underscores how diagnostic capacity itself becomes a material intervention, transforming invisible co-infections into treatable conditions and reshaping the relationship between exposure, disease development, and survival.",

Within the rhizomes of this medicinal plant, altitude operates as a material condition that simultaneously shapes two entangled systems: the microbial assemblages that colonize the tissue and the accumulation of bioactive compounds that determine the plant's pharmaceutical value. This paper documents how elevation does not simply stress the plant into producing more alkaloids, but rather how shifts in microbial community structure at different altitudes appear coupled to metabolite production—a relationship that positions certain plant-internal microbe microorganisms as potential tools for enhancing alkaloid yields, yet leaves unexamined what economic pressures or agricultural practices might drive the selection and intensification of such microbial-chemical assemblages in cultivation.",

The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of multiple mycological assays using updated diagnostic criteria from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group and the Fungal University-affiliated Diagnostic Criteria. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan testing demonstrated the strongest individual performance, detecting the fungus in 85.5% of infected patients while correctly identifying 82.9% of uninfected patients as negative. Serum galactomannan alone showed poor sensitivity (41.7%) but high specificity (89.2%), and combining serum galactomannan with culture or molecular testing methods increased specificity above 95%. The paper identified independent risk factors for death through multivariate statistical analysis, though the abstract text cuts off before detailing these findings.

Self-powered electrochemical sensor (SPES) has become a hot spot of research for its fast responses, simple operation and good stability.

Moreover, MBs-assisted strategy was used to one-to-many signal amplification, realizing AFB1 detection with a detection limit down to 0.058 pg/mL.

The system uses a fuel-free approach where light-driven reactions cycle between a photocathode and photoanode, producing an output voltage of 733.6 millivolts without requiring external power or chemical fuel. Magnetic nanobeads attached to aflatoxin B1 molecules amplified the detection signal, allowing the sensor to identify the toxin at concentrations as low as 0.058 picograms per millilitre. The paper reports successful detection of aflatoxin B1 in actual moldy corn samples, positioning the technology as applicable to food safety monitoring.  The device emerges from a material entanglement between fungal toxicity and technological remediation. Aflatoxin B1—a metabolic product of mould growth in stored grain—becomes simultaneously a target contaminant and a resource for demonstrating sensor performance. The fuel-free photocatalytic strategy, powered by light rather than chemical or electrical input, reveals a deeper dependency: rapid detection of mould-produced toxins in food systems depends on energy-intensive technological infrastructure, even when that infrastructure is designed to minimize battery consumption. The sensor's ability to function in actual moldy corn samples suggests that detecting fungal harm in agricultural commodities now requires nanoscale engineering and photochemical processes—a pattern of technological escalation that reflects broader shifts in how human food security is managed through material intervention rather than prevention of mould growth itself.",

This study investigates the protective effects of DB against AFB1-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to control, AFB1, DB, and AFB1&#8201;+&#8201;DB groups, receiving oral treatments for 4 weeks. The results showed that DB significantly alleviated AFB1-induced weight loss and liver damage, as evidenced by histopathological changes and serum biochemical markers. DB reduced hepatic H&#8322;O&#8322; and MDA levels, enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as T-SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-1&#946;, and TNF-&#945; genes, and modulated metabolic enzymes by downregulating Phase I genes (CYP1A2, CYP3A11) while upregulating the Phase II gene GSTA3.

The compound reduced weight loss and liver damage, lowered levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (markers of cellular damage), and increased activity of protective enzymes including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Dipsacoside B also suppressed inflammatory gene expression and altered the activity of liver metabolic enzymes, reducing those that activate aflatoxin B1 while enhancing those that neutralize it. The compound restored mitochondrial structure damaged by the toxin and blocked programmed cell death pathways by restoring protective proteins and reducing death-promoting factors.  The findings reveal a dual material relationship: aflatoxin B1 emerges as both a widespread contamination hazard in food systems and a clinical problem requiring intervention, while dipsacoside B functions simultaneously as a plant-derived therapeutic agent and as evidence of how natural compounds can be mobilized to manage exposures rooted in agricultural storage and feed production. The study documents how a single protective mechanism—activation of a cellular stress-response pathway—operates across multiple biological systems simultaneously, suggesting that managing mould-related harm depends not on eliminating the toxin alone but on enhancing the body's capacity to metabolize and neutralize it, a capacity that varies with access to specific plant-derived compounds.",

However, their roles in stress physiology remain poorly defined, particularly in filamentous cyanobacteria. Here, we characterize cyanoglobule dynamics and composition during nitrogen starvation in a non-diazotrophic derivative of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. This experimental context enables analysis of sustained nitrogen deprivation in vegetative cells without the transient and heterogeneous effects of heterocyst differentiation and nitrogenase activity, while recognizing that the strain does not represent wild-type physiology. Nitrogen starvation induced striking morphological remodeling, including increased cyanoglobule size and abundance. Proteomic analysis revealed a cyanoglobule proteome enriched in homologs of the plant plastoglobule proteome as well as other redox regulators and isoprenoid metabolism enzymes, pointing to roles in pigment turnover and stress adaptation.

    "summary": "Nitrogen starvation triggered substantial structural changes in lipid droplets within vegetative cells of a non-nitrogen-fixing Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 mutant strain, with cyanoglobules increasing in both size and number. protein-level analysis analysis identified proteins in these lipid droplets that resemble those found in plant chloroplast lipid droplets, alongside enzymes involved in redox regulation and the synthesis of isoprenoid compounds. Lipidome profiling detected elevated concentrations of plastoquinone derivatives and related prenyl-lipid molecules, indicating active remodeling of photosynthetic pigments and lipid metabolism during nutrient deprivation. The experimental design—using a strain unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen—allowed sustained observation of nitrogen starvation effects in ordinary vegetative cells without the confounding effects of specialized nitrogen-fixing cell differentiation.  Within the material entanglements of nutrient scarcity, lipid droplets emerge as sites where cellular stress becomes visible and metabolically actionable. The cyanobacterium's capacity to accumulate and restructure these lipid bodies under nitrogen deprivation reveals how single-celled photosynthetic organisms mobilize existing biochemical machinery—redox enzymes, pigment turnover pathways, isoprenoid metabolism—to persist through resource limitation. Yet this same stress response, documented here in a laboratory mutant stripped of its wild-type capacity for atmospheric nitrogen fixation, points to a narrowed ecological niche: the strain's reliance on external nitrogen sources makes it dependent on conditions of supply that may be absent or unstable in natural environments, rendering its stress adaptation strategies both adaptive and constraining.",

    "summary": "Onion bulbs undergo marked microbial restructuring during postharvest rotting, with bacterial diversity expanding dramatically as tissue deteriorates. This paper used high-throughput genetic sequencing of over 2 million DNA reads to map bacterial and fungal communities across three tissue types—neck, outer scale, and central tissue—in healthy, mildly rotten, and severely rotten bulbs. The analysis identified 85 bacterial and 53 fungal distinct types across nine samples. Bacterial diversity increased from 8 genera in healthy bulbs to 36 genera in mildly rotten bulbs, then contracted sharply to 11 genera in severely rotten tissue. Seven bacterial genera—including Lactobacillus, Novosphingobium, Sphingobium, Pluralibacter, Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Pantoea—appeared exclusively in rotten bulbs and were entirely absent from healthy tissue.  The tissue-specific microbial patterning documented here reveals how onion storage conditions create differentiated ecological niches where spoilage organisms colonize and proliferate. The same bacterial genera that mark bulb deterioration and render onions unmarketable are simultaneously the organisms that drive the metabolic breakdown of stored plant material—they are both the sign and the mechanism of economic loss. The capacity of these microbial assemblages to rapidly restructure across bulb tissues suggests that postharvest onion loss is not simply a problem of preventing contamination, but rather a problem of managing the material conditions that allow certain microbial communities to dominate and transform stored plant tissue into sites of decay.",

    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Microbiology Spectrum: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "The capacity of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> to cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis depends on its ability to adapt to dynamic and stressful microenvironments within the host. Epigenetic regulation, including histone deacetylation, plays a critical role in fungal adaptation to stress. Here, we investigated the role of the class I histone deacetylase HosA in <i>A. fumigatus</i> stress resistance, host cell interactions, and virulence. A Δ<i>hosA</i> mutant had increased susceptibility to intracellular oxidant stress induced by menadione. It also had impaired capacity to invade and damage two pulmonary epithelial cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. In a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model of invasive aspergillosis, mice infected with the Δ<i>hosA</i> mutant survived significantly longer than those infected with the wild-type strain, despite having similar pulmonary fungal burden. The Δ<i>hosA</i> mutant also induced a weaker inflammatory response than the wild-type strain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HosA regulates genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and energy metabolism, functioning as both an activator and repressor of distinct gene sets. Collectively, these results indicate that HosA is a key epigenetic regulator that governs <i>A. fumigatus</i> interactions with host cells and virulence during invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.IMPORTANCEEpigenetic modifications in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> can be induced by environmental changes and stresses such as those induced by interaction with host cells. HosA, a class I histone deacetylase, has been shown to play a key role in regulating secondary metabolism in several <i>Aspergillus</i> species, but its function in <i>A. fumigatus</i> was previously unknown.

    "summary": "This paper investigated how the HosA histone deacetylase—an enzyme that removes chemical tags from histone proteins to alter gene expression—controls stress survival, interactions with lung cells, and disease-causing capacity in *Aspergillus fumigatus*, the fungus responsible for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. When researchers deleted the *hosA* gene, the resulting mutant strain became more vulnerable to oxidative stress generated inside cells by the chemical menadione, and showed reduced ability to invade and damage two types of lung epithelial cells in laboratory culture. In immune-suppressed mice infected with the *hosA* deletion mutant, survival time was significantly longer than in mice infected with the normal strain, despite equivalent fungal burden in the lungs; the mutant also triggered a weaker inflammatory response. Gene expression analysis showed that HosA controls genes involved in secondary metabolite production and energy metabolism, acting as both an activator and repressor depending on the specific genes involved.  The findings reveal a material entanglement between fungal adaptation machinery and host vulnerability. The same epigenetic regulator that enables the fungus to survive the oxidative assault of immune cells also drives the inflammatory damage that characterizes invasive disease—a duality where disease-causing ability and survival are mechanistically linked rather than separable traits. The reduced pathology in mice infected with the *hosA* mutant, despite persistent fungal presence, suggests that controlling this single epigenetic switch could decouple fungal persistence from the tissue destruction that makes aspergillosis lethal, pointing toward how molecular interventions might reshape the outcome of human-fungal encounters without necessarily eliminating the organism.",

Within fermented food systems, the same fungal proteins that determine whether *Aspergillus oryzae* thrives in rice-koji also reshape the final product's chemistry. This reveals how a single organism's metabolic capacity—its ability to grow, survive, and transform materials—simultaneously structures both the biological growth medium it colonizes and the commercial product that emerges.

Fe, N co-doped biochar (FeNBC) was synthesized from straw and integrated with sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation during oil aqueous refining. FeNBC activated sodium bisulfite to generate reactive oxygen species, degrading AFB1 that migrated into the aqueous phase. Over 98% of AFB1 (100 μg/L) was removed from oil within 50 min, with a reaction rate constant 3.02 times higher than that of pristine biochar and negligible impact on oil quality. Quenching and site-poisoning experiments identified Fe-Nx as the main catalytic site, with singlet oxygen and superoxide radical as the dominant active species. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that N-coordination modulates the Fe d-band center, facilitates charge redistribution, and promotes Fe valence cycling, thereby enhancing bisulfite adsorption and overcoming electron-transfer limitations during activation.

The biochar activated sodium bisulfite to produce reactive oxygen species that broke down aflatoxin B1 migrating into the aqueous phase of the refining process, removing over 98% of the toxin (at 100 micrograms per litre) within 50 minutes. The reaction proceeded 3.02 times faster than with untreated biochar, while leaving oil quality unaffected. Experiments isolating specific catalytic sites and reactive species identified iron-nitrogen coordination complexes as the primary active sites, with singlet oxygen and superoxide radical as the dominant degradation agents. Electrochemical measurements and computational modelling showed that nitrogen coordination altered the electronic structure of iron atoms, redistributed charge, enabled cycling between iron valence states, and enhanced both the binding of bisulfite and electron transfer during the activation process.  The research embeds a food safety intervention within material transformations that reveal deeper dependencies in commodity processing. The same straw-derived biochar that serves as a detoxification technology also demonstrates how agricultural residues can be repositioned as industrial catalysts—a shift that depends on precise control of elemental composition and surface chemistry. The capacity to degrade a mycotoxin while preserving oil quality illustrates the narrow technical margins within which food safety operates under industrial pressure, and the reliance on engineered materials to manage contamination that arises from prior ecological or storage failures.",

Four of these compounds are pyrazine derivatives (compounds 1–4) and one is an isobenzofuran derivative (compound 5). The structures were determined through spectroscopic analysis and comparison of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism curves. Three of the five compounds (1, 4, and 5) inhibited the differentiation of bone-resorbing cells in laboratory cell cultures treated with a signalling molecule called RANKL, and these same three compounds restored bone mineralization in zebrafish larvae exposed to dexamethasone, a drug that induces bone loss.

Within the context of turbulent material transformations, this research reveals how an plant-internal microbe fungus nested within plant tissue produces molecules with dual potential: they function simultaneously as metabolic byproducts of fungal life and as bioactive compounds capable of modulating human bone physiology. The capacity of *Alternaria* to synthesize complex organic structures—pyrazines and isobenzofurans—demonstrates the fungus not merely as a passive inhabitant of plant tissue but as an active biochemical factory whose outputs can be redirected toward pharmaceutical use.

    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Temperature and moisture content are recognized as the main factors responsible for mycotoxin production in stored grain, while the role of gaseous environment, particularly interstitial CO 2, remains unexplored. This study investigated the relationship between interstitial CO 2 concentration (generated metabolically in air spaces between grain kernels) and deoxynivalenol (DON) production in stored wheat under varying moisture contents (13%, 15%, 17%, 20%, or 23%), Fusarium treatments (naturally infected, Fusarium ‐inoculated, disinfected, or disinfected + Fusarium ‐inoculated), and airtight durations (1, 3, 6, or 12 days). RESULTS Moisture was the dominant factor affecting both CO 2 and DON production, explaining most of the observed variance. Fusarium inoculation significantly increased interstitial CO 2 concentration, daily CO 2 production (generated interstitially depending on airtight duration), and accumulated CO 2 production (accumulated interstitially until the end of the storage period). Airtight duration significantly affected CO 2 production and influenced DON concentrations. A significant positive correlation ( r = 0.87, P &lt; 0.001) between interstitial CO 2 and log 10 ‐transformed DON concentration was obtained. CONCLUSION Wheat with &lt;20% interstitial CO 2 concentration remained below safety thresholds for DON concentration, and &gt;30% interstitial CO 2 was found in 60% of DON‐contaminated samples, suggesting a cut‐off for safe storage and that monitoring of interstitial CO 2 concentration during grain storage may provide a helpful indication of the risk of grain quality loss.

    "summary": "Moisture content dominated the factors affecting both interstitial carbon dioxide concentration and deoxynivalenol accumulation in this study of stored wheat. Fusarium inoculation significantly increased the metabolic production of carbon dioxide in the air spaces between grain kernels, with effects varying according to how long the grain was stored in airtight conditions. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) emerged between interstitial carbon dioxide concentration and deoxynivalenol levels, with wheat samples containing less than 20 percent interstitial carbon dioxide remaining below safety thresholds for the mycotoxin, while over 60 percent of contaminated samples exceeded 30 percent interstitial carbon dioxide.  This paper reveals how a metabolic byproduct—carbon dioxide exhaled by fungal and grain respiration—simultaneously signals danger and enables detection. The gaseous environment within sealed grain storage, previously overlooked in favour of temperature and moisture monitoring, emerges as a material marker of the conditions under which Fusarium thrives and produces its toxic metabolites. The capacity to measure interstitial carbon dioxide offers a practical surveillance tool for grain handlers navigating the turbulent economics of food storage, yet this same measurement capacity depends on the very sealed conditions—airtight containers, accumulated microbial respiration—that intensify the problem it seeks to monitor.",

    "excerpt": "Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and a major contribution to tumor progression and resistance to therapies arise from tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor is indeed able to shape a self-permissive TME, reprogramming the cellular components into allies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), abundant in BC TME, mainly acquire an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype able to fuel tumor progression, immune evasion, metastasis and therapy resistance through a dynamic crosstalk with cancer cells. MicroRNAs, transferred via extracellular vesicles and exploited by the tumor to mold an immunesuppressive niche, act as central mediators of this bidirectional communication: tumor-derived miRNAs can reprogram macrophages toward an M2-like functional program, and TAM-derived miRNAs in turn promote and sustain cancer cell progression. This miRNA-orchestrated plasticity highlights TAMs as key TME regulators. Clinically, miRNA modulation offers promising strategies for TAM reprogramming, alongside their utility as prognostic biomarkers.

The study describes tumor-associated macrophages—immune cells that accumulate in breast cancer tissue—as primarily adopting an immunosuppressive form that promotes tumor growth, immune evasion, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. The paper identifies microRNAs, which are transferred between cells via extracellular vesicles (small membrane-bound packages), as central mediators of communication between cancer cells and macrophages. Tumor-derived microRNAs reprogram macrophages toward an immunosuppressive functional state, while macrophage-derived microRNAs in turn sustain cancer cell progression, creating a bidirectional exchange. This study proposes that modulating microRNAs offers clinical potential both for redirecting macrophage behavior and as prognostic markers to predict patient outcomes.  Within the patchy landscape of breast cancer, this paper documents how a single molecular mechanism—microRNA transfer—simultaneously enables tumor survival and creates a point of intervention. The immunosuppressive macrophages that accumulate in high numbers within tumors are not fixed cellular states but rather plastic entities continuously reshaped through molecular crosstalk; the same signaling system that allows tumors to construct a permissive niche could theoretically be disrupted to dismantle it. This dual capacity—microRNAs as both instruments of tumor control and potential therapeutic targets—reveals how the material entanglement of cancer cells and immune cells produces both deepening dependency and latent vulnerability.",

Two hundred and ninety samples of oil seed cakes and formulated feeds were collected from the randomly selected feed vendors. The samples were analysed for aflatoxin B1 using a Helica&#174; Aflatoxin B1 (low matrix) Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit. To validate the ELISA results, a subset of randomly selected samples was further analysed using High-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). The results indicated that 92% of poultry ration, 72% of dairy ration, 66% of linseed cake, 64% of noug seed cake, 61% of cotton seed cake, and 36% of soybean cake were contaminated with AFB1 exceeding the permissible level (20&amp;nbsp;&#181;g/kg)&amp;nbsp;in Ethiopia. To evaluate fungal diversity, genomic DNA was extracted, pooled by feed type, and sequenced. The findings revealed variations in the diversity indices of fungal phyla, families, genera and species. The Metabarcoding results revealed Ascomycota as the dominant phylum in all feeds, with Aspergillaceae, Nectriaceae, Botyosphaeriaceae, and Cladosporiaceae being the dominant families.

The study identified multiple fungal species co-occurring in single samples, some of which are documented as harmful.  The contamination landscape documented here reveals how livestock feed markets in this urban setting function simultaneously as sites of animal health risk and as material nodes where fungal metabolic capacity — the ability of moulds to proliferate and produce toxins under storage conditions — becomes entangled with labour practices, regulatory gaps, and economic pressures on feed handlers. The high prevalence of aflatoxin B1 across feed types suggests not a failure of feed safety systems alone, but rather the operation of those systems within conditions of constrained resources and competing priorities, where the same feed materials that pose toxicological hazards to livestock also reflect the material dependencies and exposures embedded in informal market chains.",

    "excerpt": "Fungal spores, a common component of biological air pollution, may negatively affect human health by triggering allergic symptoms. To assess the risk of exposure to allergens, abundant and highly allergenic Alternaria spp. and Cladosporium spp. spore concentrations are routinely measured, but almost exclusively on rooftops. In contrast, research on concentrations at ground-level, where people spend most of their time outdoors, is scarce. Although there is evidence that the main source of fungal spores is agricultural areas during harvest, it remains unclear how the proximity of crops influences ground-level spore concentrations. To address this, portable volumetric traps and meteorological stations were used to conduct three ground-level measurement campaigns (before, during, and after harvesting) throughout the main sporulation season in 2023. Nine sampling points in Poznań (Poland) represented the main land use types: agricultural, urban, and forest. The maximum concentrations were 1,369 spores/m<sup>3</sup> (Alternaria, 47% higher than the rooftop maximum) and 88,820 spores/m<sup>3</sup> (Cladosporium, 458% higher), both recorded in agricultural areas. On average, concentrations of Cladosporium spores increased during harvest, whereas Alternaria concentrations substantially increased after harvest. The highest concentrations of Alternaria and Cladosporium spores were associated with air influxes from arable land (rho = 0.20 and 0.35, respectively) and grasslands (only Cladosporium, rho = 0.24). Overall, we successfully established an extensive, mobile, ground-level spore measurement network, which revealed differences in fungal spore concentrations across land-use types, harvest activities, and in comparison with regional-level measurements.

Ground-level concentrations substantially exceeded those typically recorded on rooftops: Alternaria reached 1,369 spores per cubic metre (47 percent higher than rooftop measurements) and Cladosporium reached 88,820 spores per cubic metre (458 percent higher), with both maxima occurring in agricultural areas. Cladosporium spore concentrations increased during harvest, while Alternaria concentrations rose substantially after harvest. Air masses originating from arable land showed the strongest association with elevated spore levels for both species, while grasslands correlated specifically with Cladosporium elevation.  The findings expose a material geography of exposure shaped by harvesting labour and crop proximity. Ground-level measurements—where human bodies actually encounter spores during outdoor work and leisure—reveal concentrations orders of magnitude above what regional rooftop monitoring networks detect, yet these measurements remain absent from standard allergen surveillance. The timing of peak Alternaria after harvest, rather than during it, suggests that crop disturbance mobilizes spores not only at the moment of mechanical harvesting but through subsequent soil and plant residue decomposition, creating a prolonged window of exposure tied to agricultural cycles. This study documents how exposure risk is not evenly distributed across landscapes but concentrated in proximity to arable land, implicating both the material practices of food production and the spatial positioning of human populations as determinants of who encounters elevated fungal allergen loads.",

The microbial shifts documented in this paper reveal a material entanglement characteristic of postharvest preservation: the same botanical extract that kills a primary pathogen simultaneously reshapes the broader microbial assemblage on fruit surfaces, favouring certain bacterial taxa over others. This selective suppression of spoilage organisms while promoting beneficial bacteria suggests that clove extract operates not as a blunt chemical fungicide but as a modifier of the competitive landscape among microorganisms inhabiting strawberry tissue—a shift that preserves fruit quality through ecological rather than purely antimicrobial means, yet remains contingent on storage conditions and the specific microbial composition of each harvest lot.",

    "source": "Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Fusarium culmorum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereals, leading to significant yield losses and contamination with type B trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives 3‐ADON and 15‐ADON. Due to the limitations of chemical fungicides, there is increasing interest in sustainable alternatives. Naturally occurring antioxidants have shown potential in modulating fungal growth and mycotoxin production. RESULTS This study evaluated the effects of 11 natural antioxidant compounds on Fusarium culmorum growth and trichothecene production, both in vitro and in planta. In vitro : octyl gallate ( 7 ), honokiol ( 9 ), and magnolol ( 10 ) completely inhibited fungal growth and trichothecene production at 0.5 mmol L −1 . In planta : octyl gallate ( 7 ), reduced the disease index to 0.63% and total mycotoxin levels by 90% while honokiol ( 9 ), and ascorbic acid ( 1 ) exhibited notable inhibition in both disease severity and mycotoxin accumulation. The equimolar combination of ascorbic acid and tocopherol demonstrated synergistic inhibition of DON and 3‐ADON in vitro , though its efficacy in planta was moderate. No correlation was found in vitro between the antioxidant or lipophilic properties and antifungal efficacy, whereas in planta experiments revealed a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and trichothecene suppression. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro–Wilks, Levene and analysis of variance tests ( P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Natural antioxidants, particularly octyl gallate and honokiol, represent promising candidates for controlling F. culmorum and reducing trichothecene contamination in cereals. Their application could contribute to safer food by reducing trichothecene levels through environmentally friendly strategies. Further research is needed to optimize formulations and assess field‐level efficacy. © 2026 The Author(s). Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture published by Jo",

    "summary": "Fusarium culmorum, which causes Fusarium head blight in cereals, produces type B trichothecene mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol and its acetylated variants. This paper tested 11 natural antioxidant compounds against the fungus in controlled conditions and in living cereal plants. In laboratory cultures, octyl gallate, honokiol, and magnolol completely stopped fungal growth and toxin production at a concentration of 0.5 millimoles per litre. In cereal plants, octyl gallate reduced disease severity to 0.63 percent and total mycotoxin levels by 90 percent, while honokiol and ascorbic acid also showed substantial suppression of both disease and toxin accumulation. A combination of ascorbic acid and tocopherol showed combined-effect suppression of deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol in laboratory conditions, though its effectiveness in plants was moderate.  Within cereal crops, the antioxidant capacity of these compounds correlated with their ability to suppress trichothecene production—a relationship not observed in laboratory cultures. This divergence reveals how the same natural compounds operate differently across material contexts: in the simplified chemistry of a petri dish, antioxidant strength does not predict fungal control, yet within the complex tissue environment of a growing plant, antioxidant activity becomes a reliable indicator of toxin suppression. The findings suggest that octyl gallate and honokiol function not simply as fungal poisons but as modulators of the plant-fungus interaction itself, their efficacy dependent on the living system in which they operate rather than on their chemical properties alone.",

While some probiotics are known to mitigate DON toxicity, the multifaceted protective effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus MY-1—a strain with high DON-degradation capacity and a proven safety profile—require comprehensive evaluation. This study aimed to systematically assess the ability of MY-1 to alleviate DON-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.MethodsInvestigations were conducted in vitro using IPEC-J2 cells and in vivo using a BALB/c mouse model. We examined the effects of MY-1 on cell viability, ultrastructure, oxidative stress markers (MDA, T-AOC), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-4), apoptosis-related genes (BAX, Caspase-3, BCL-2), and tight junction protein (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1) expression.

    "summary": "This study examined how Lactobacillus rhamnosus MY-1, a bacterial strain capable of breaking down deoxynivalenol, protects intestinal cells and animal hosts from damage caused by this mycotoxin. The paper reports findings from both laboratory experiments using intestinal cell cultures and living mouse models. In cell cultures, the bacterial supernatant restored cell survival and reversed structural damage to cells exposed to deoxynivalenol. The strain reduced markers of cellular damage from oxidative stress, lowered inflammatory signalling molecules, and preserved the expression of proteins that maintain the physical integrity of the intestinal barrier. In mice, the bacterial treatment modulated the composition and diversity of gut microorganisms that had been disrupted by toxin exposure.  The dual capacity of this bacterial strain—simultaneously a consumer of a mould-derived poison and a modifier of the microbial ecosystem that follows contamination—reveals how remediation operates within the lived body. The restoration of barrier function and microbial balance does not erase the prior exposure to deoxynivalenol but rather absorbs and redirects its consequences, rendering the toxin metabolically useful while restoring a particular order to the gut ecology. This locates the probiotic not as a simple antidote but as an agent that transforms the material and biological aftermath of grain contamination into a recoverable state—a recovery that depends entirely on the strain's capacity to persist and function within the specific conditions of feed systems and animal bodies shaped by agricultural practice.",

    "summary": "This paper documents the detection of *Mycetohabitans endofungorum*, a bacterium that lives within fungal cells, circulating in patient blood as a marker of invasive mucormycosis infection. The isolation of this bacterial symbiont in blood cultures may indicate active invasion by the mould *Rhizopus* or related species, even in patients lacking classical immunocompromising conditions such as haematologic malignancy or organ transplantation. The authors propose that transient physiologic stress—such as uncontrolled metabolic disease or acute infection—combined with disruption of physical barriers (respiratory epithelium, gastrointestinal mucosa, or skin) can permit fungal invasion in otherwise immunologically intact hosts. Early identification of *M. endofungorum* bacteremia could serve as a diagnostic signal for invasive mucormycosis before conventional clinical or radiological signs emerge, potentially enabling faster clinical intervention.  The finding reveals a material entanglement between human immune vulnerability and fungal-bacterial assemblages that operates outside conventional risk stratification. The same bacterial symbiont that signals danger—a marker of life-threatening fungal invasion—is ordinarily a benign inhabitant of fungal cytoplasm, mobilized into pathogenic circulation only when specific conditions of host stress and tissue breach align. This suggests that invasive mucormycosis is not simply a disease of the immune-weakened but emerges from contingent interactions between transient physiologic states, environmental exposure, and the metabolic capacities of fungal-bacterial partnerships. The diagnostic utility of detecting a symbiont rather than the pathogenic fungus itself demonstrates how clinical recognition of disease depends on understanding the relational ecologies of infection, not merely the presence of a single causative agent.",

Diabetic foot infection (DFI) involves diverse causative pathogens however, the potential for fungal etiologies is often overlooked. We describe a case of DFI following foot trauma. Despite prior broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, the wound failed to heal and presented persistent swelling and pain. Microbiological re-evaluation and molecular identification confirmed the causative agent as Fusarium keratoplasticum (F. keratoplasticum), a pathogenic species within Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC). The isolate exhibited high MICs against most antifungals, thus systemic antifungal therapy was withheld. Successful management was achieved through systematic surgical debridement combined with silver-ion dressings, resulting in pathogen eradication and complete wound healing. Currently, F. keratoplasticum infections remain extremely limited, particularly those definitively confirmed to species level. This case broadens the pathogen spectrum of DFI and highlights the need for comprehensive etiologic evaluation in therapy-refractory wounds, offering a non-pharmacological strategy for resistant fungal infections.",

The patient presented with a non-healing wound, persistent swelling, and pain following foot trauma; microbiological re-evaluation and molecular identification confirmed the fungal diagnosis. The isolated pathogen exhibited high minimum inhibitory concentrations against most antifungal drugs, making systemic antifungal treatment unsuitable. Successful resolution was achieved through repeated surgical removal of damaged tissue combined with silver-ion wound dressings, which resulted in complete pathogen eradication and wound healing. This paper notes that confirmed cases of Fusarium keratoplasticum infection remain extremely rare in the literature.  The case reveals a material entanglement characteristic of contemporary wound management: antimicrobial therapy, designed to eliminate bacterial pathogens, created conditions favourable for fungal colonization, only to be replaced by a non-pharmaceutical strategy—silver-ion dressings combined with surgical intervention—that proved effective where drugs failed. This pattern reflects broader dependencies in diabetic foot care, where the body's metabolic vulnerabilities and the material properties of wounds create openings for opportunistic fungi that conventional pharmaceutical approaches cannot address, necessitating a shift toward mechanical and chemical remediation through specific material interventions.",

    "excerpt": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), primarily caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus, is a life-threatening fungal infection with high mortality rates. This study investigated novel resistance mechanisms to caspofungin (CAS) in clinical Aspergillus isolates with particular focus on genetic alterations in the CoQ5 gene and their functional implications. One hundred and forty-eight Aspergillus isolates from IPA cases were undergone antifungal susceptibility testing, genotyping and phylogenetic analyses, mutations and gene expression studies of Fks1 and CoQ5 genes, and three-dimensional structural analysis of wild-type and mutant CoQ5 proteins. The etiologic agents of IPA comprised A. flavus (72.3%) and A. fumigatus (27.7%). Caspofungin (CAS) resistance was reported in 7.4% of A. flavus and 9.7% of A. fumigatus isolates. Genetic analysis identified a novel mutation in the CoQ5 gene (T371C) resulting in an amino acid substitution (Y102H) in a CAS-resistant A. flavus isolate. Structural modeling suggests this variant may impair protein stability and mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to resistance through indirect mechanisms. The definitive establishment of causality and direct contribution of CoQ5 mutations to caspofungin susceptibility requires further functional validation by employing targeted genetic manipulation and phenotypic validation to directly interrogate the role of the Y102H variant in the resistance mechanism.",

The isolates comprised Aspergillus flavus (72.3%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (27.7%), with caspofungin resistance detected in 7.4% of A. flavus and 9.7% of A. fumigatus isolates. A novel mutation in the CoQ5 gene (a DNA change from T to C at position 371, resulting in a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at position 102 in the protein) was identified in one caspofungin-resistant A. flavus isolate. Three-dimensional structural modeling of the mutant protein suggested the variant may reduce protein stability and impair mitochondrial function, potentially contributing to resistance through indirect pathways, though the authors acknowledge that direct causality remains unproven without further genetic manipulation experiments.  The resistance mechanism documented here reveals a material entanglement between fungal metabolism and pharmaceutical pressure. The CoQ5 protein, which functions in cellular energy production within mitochondria, appears to be recruited into a resistance strategy not through direct interaction with the drug but through structural changes that destabilize the protein itself—a paradoxical mode where cellular dysfunction becomes a survival strategy. This pattern reflects how antifungal resistance emerges not simply as adaptive advantage but as a byproduct of turbulent pharmaceutical exposure within clinical settings where certain fungal lineages accumulate selective advantage through metabolic reorganization rather than conventional target-site modification.",

In the present study, we report a case of a patient with CLL, with an in-range absolute neutrophil count and an isolated Aspergillus fumigatus brain abscess mimicking a brain tumor.

The patient's white blood cell count remained within normal range, yet the fungal infection penetrated the central nervous system and presented as a space-occupying lesion resembling a tumour. Surgical removal of the abscess followed by antifungal treatment with voriconazole was undertaken; cultures confirmed the organism's sensitivity to both amphotericin and voriconazole.

The case reveals a material entanglement between pharmaceutical innovation and fungal risk that standard clinical monitoring fails to anticipate. A drug engineered to improve safety outcomes in cancer treatment paradoxically created conditions for a pathogenic fungus to establish itself in neural tissue—not through obvious immunosuppression marked by low white blood cell counts, but through more subtle disruptions in immune function that remain clinically invisible until the fungus has already colonized and grown. The mould here is neither simply a threat nor a resource, but a trace of the hidden costs embedded in the management of one disease through pharmaceutical intervention, costs that emerge unpredictably in individual bodies and remain difficult to detect through conventional clinical parameters.",

In the present study, an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus velezensis NEAU-HLD-9, was isolated from healthy bean seeds and exhibited strong inhibitory activity against Botrytis cinerea. This strain could form biofilms, enhance the activity of defense enzymes, and boost the content of active secondary metabolites in green beans. The crude lipopeptide extracts from NEAU-HLD-9 remarkably suppressed the mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea. It is worth noting that the crude lipopeptide extracts also effectively controlled gray mold in green beans by reducing both disease incidence and lesion diameter. PCR and LC-MS analyses suggested that the crude lipopeptide extracts comprised two antifungal compounds. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the strain contained 15 gene clusters responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis, including those for antifungal compounds.

The strain demonstrated inhibitory activity against the pathogen both in laboratory conditions and on stored beans, reducing disease incidence and the size of lesions on fruit tissue. The bacterium produced surface-bound microbial communities and elevated the activity of plant defense enzymes and secondary metabolites within green bean tissue. Chemical analysis using polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified two antifungal compounds within crude lipopeptide extracts derived from the strain, and whole genome sequencing revealed 15 gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite production, including those encoding antifungal substances. When applied as crude lipopeptide extracts, these compounds suppressed both mycelial growth and spore germination of Botrytis cinerea laboratory-based and reduced disease on stored green beans in living organisms.  Within postharvest commodity chains, this bacterium and its chemical products operate simultaneously as disease suppressors and as metabolic interventions that alter the biochemistry of the host plant itself. The same lipopeptide compounds that inhibit fungal growth also restructure the plant's own defense apparatus—a dual action that reveals how microbial control does not simply remove a pathogen but redistributes biological activity across the human-crop-microbe assemblage. The capacity of Bacillus velezensis to colonize seeds and persist within plant tissue, while simultaneously producing antifungal metabolites, demonstrates how a single organism can serve as both a living intervention technology and a source of extractable compounds, each with distinct economic and logistical implications for agricultural systems managing spoilage in stored green beans.",

This paper tested Aureobasidium pullulans S2, a fungal biocontrol agent, against these infections and found that it reduced both the occurrence and severity of disease while strengthening the grape's own defense enzyme activity and accumulation of protective compounds. The mechanism of action involved a volatile organic compound called 2-Phenylethanol, produced by A. pullulans S2, which damaged the cell membranes of the pathogenic fungi and triggered the buildup of reactive oxygen species—molecules that degrade cellular components—within those pathogens. The researchers also developed a freeze-dried formulation of A. pullulans S2 using optimized protective agents, achieving an 85.2 percent survival rate of the organism after the freeze-drying process and maintaining significant disease control capacity after 90 days of storage.  This study documents the dual material capacity of a fungal agent: A. pullulans S2 operates simultaneously as a disease suppressor and as a preserved commodity. The freeze-dried formulation reveals the dependencies embedded in biocontrol—the organism's efficacy depends on its survival through industrial processing and extended storage, transforming a living antagonist into a shelf-stable product whose viability must be engineered and maintained. The pathogenic moulds themselves become sites where multiple metabolic processes converge: they are agricultural threats requiring management, yet their vulnerability to A. pullulans S2's chemical outputs exposes how fungal interactions in postharvest systems are shaped by material conditions—skin integrity, nutrient availability, storage duration—that are themselves products of agricultural and commercial practice.",

    "title": "AnBir1: a conserved fungal inhibitor of apoptosis regulates caspase activity and core processes in Aspergillus nidulans",
    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Genetics and Biology",
    "excerpt": "Regulated cell death (RCD) is a highly conserved and coordinated cellular demise process. In animals, the fate of cells depends on the precise regulation of RCD, with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) playing a major role as negative regulators of cellular death. In fungi, RCD regulates crucial processes, including growth, development, stress response, host-pathogen interactions and more. However, the biochemical details of this process are not well understood in this kingdom. IAPs are, remarkably, one of the few RCD/Apoptosis-regulatory proteins that are conserved in fungi. Here, we performed large-scale bioinformatic analyses of IAPs in sequenced fungal genomes. While most fungal organisms have a single IAP gene (81.65 % of the genomes analyzed here), some fungi lack IAPs altogether and others have multiple IAP-like genes. Using the Aspergillus nidulans IAP, AnBir1, we show that this protein is required for survival and regulates cell death by inhibiting caspase-like activity. Moreover, disrupting RCD by constitutively expressing AnBir1 impacted fundamental processes, including development, stress response and secondary metabolism. We also show that fungal RCD can be hijacked for therapeutic purposes. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we targeted the AnBir1 homolog of the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SsBir1) during plant infection. Targeting SsBir1 resulted in enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum infection. We propose that IAPs play a critical role in regulating caspase activities and other RCD-related processes in fungi and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for fungal infections.",

    "summary": "This paper documents the discovery and functional characterization of AnBir1, a cell death inhibitor protein in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Through large-scale analysis of fungal genomes, this study found that most fungi (81.65 percent of those analyzed) carry a single gene encoding inhibitor of programmed cell death proteins, though some species lack these genes entirely while others possess multiple copies. Using Aspergillus nidulans as a model organism, the researchers demonstrated that AnBir1 is essential for cell survival and functions by suppressing caspase-like enzymes that would otherwise trigger programmed cell death. When AnBir1 was artificially overexpressed to prevent cell death, the fungus showed altered development, reduced stress tolerance, and changes in secondary metabolism—the production of specialized chemical compounds. The paper also tested whether disrupting this cell death pathway could serve as a disease control strategy by silencing the AnBir1 equivalent in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a fungus that infects plants, and found that this genetic intervention enhanced plant resistance to infection.  Within the context of fungal-human and fungal-plant entanglements, this research reveals how a single regulatory protein simultaneously enables fungal survival and constrains adaptive capacity. The same mechanism that allows Aspergillus nidulans to persist—the suppression of programmed cell death—also locks the organism into particular developmental and metabolic pathways, making it vulnerable when that pathway is disrupted. This duality suggests that fungal pathogens operate within narrow biochemical constraints; targeting cell death inhibition in plant pathogens like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum exploits this constraint as a point of intervention, yet the finding also exposes how deeply fungal fitness depends on the precise regulation of cellular demise across stress, growth, and host interaction.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Mitochondria play a central role in fungal metabolism, adaptation, and pathogenesis, yet the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial genomes in plant-pathogenic Alternaria species remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative mitochondrial genomes analysis of five economically important Alternaria species-Alternaria burnsii, A. tenuissima, A. arborescens, A. alternata, and A. gossypina-to investigate structural architecture, genomic variation, selection pressures, repeat element dynamics, and phylogenetic relationships. The mitochondrial genomes exhibited a conserved gene content of 13-14 core genes, 30-33 tRNA and 2 rRNA, but varied in size due to differences in intron insertions, intergenic spacers, and repetitive sequences. Strong A/U-biased codon usage was observed across species, consistent with high AT-richness and translational optimization. Purifying selection dominated across essential respiratory complexes (cox1-3, atp6-9 and cob), indicating functional constraint, while signals of positive selection and pseudogenization (disrupted rps3 in A. burnsii YUN-Z1107) suggest lineage-specific adaptations. We identified evolutionary hotspots in both coding and non-coding regions enriched with InDeLs and repeat expansions. A total of 920 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were annotated, with A. burnsii YUN-Z1107 showing the highest SSR density, particularly pentanucleotide motifs, implicating replication slippage in genome plasticity. Long repetitive elements were associated with intron mobility and possible recombination events, especially in A. arborescens YUN-Z0872. Phylogenomic analysis of 29 Ascomycota species confirmed a monophyletic Alternaria clade within Pleosporales, although limited resolution within the genus suggests complex evolutionary histories.

The study identified 920 short tandem repeats across the genomes, with Alternaria burnsii YUN-Z1107 containing the highest density, particularly five-nucleotide repeat motifs, indicating that replication errors drive genome variability.  Within the broader context of fungal adaptation to agricultural hosts, this paper reveals how mitochondrial genomes in plant pathogens maintain essential metabolic functions while accumulating lineage-specific mutations and repetitive elements that may enhance survival under cultivation stress. The tension between genomic stability in core respiratory genes and plasticity in repetitive regions suggests that the same mitochondrial features constraining pathogenic function also enable rapid adaptation to shifting agricultural conditions and chemical pressures—a dual capacity characteristic of organisms thriving within intensified crop systems.",

    "title": "In vitro impact of temperature and relative humidity on growth, sterigmatocystin production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of Aspergillus creber",
    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), 37 % of French dwellings are contaminated by molds, particularly Aspergillus species. Among these, Aspergillus creber is the most frequently detected in the bioaerosols of mold-damaged dwellings and may be contribute to various health disorders. In the context of climate change, with indoor temperatures potentially exceeding 28 °C in summer, and amid the ongoing energy crisis, the French government recommends maintaining indoor temperature at 19 °C. This raises concerns about the effects of climatic conditions i.e. temperature (T°) and relative humidity (RH), on fungal growth, sterigmatocystin (STE) production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these molds. We therefore cultured three reference strains of Aspergillus creber under four common dwelling conditions (A: 19 °C, 50 % RH; B 19 °C, 75 % RH; C: 28 °C, 50 % RH; D: 28 °C, 75 % RH) on five different culture media (MEA, MEA+10 % NaCl, CYA, CY20S, and M40Y). Temperature significantly influenced growth (mean diameters: 19 °C: 22.8 mm; 28 °C: 34.4 mm; mean biomasses: 19 °C: 108.3 mg; 28 °C: 329.1 mg), STE production (mean concentrations: 19 °C: 3.5 μg/g/28 °C: 34.5 μg/g), and the MICs of antifungal agents, with a notable association between increased temperature and elevated MICs. The highest STE production (up to 99 μg/g) occurred at 28 °C on M40Y agar. Positive correlations were observed between diameters and biomass (r = 0.791; p < 0.0001), diameters and STE production (r = 0.431; p < 0.0001), and biomass and STE production (r = 0.305; p < 0.0001), suggesting a strong link between primary growth and secondary metabolism. These findings highlight the potential health risks posed by rising indoor temperatures, as projected under global climate change, which may lead to increased STE production in Aspergillus creber.",

This paper found that temperature was the dominant driver of fungal behaviour across all measured parameters. At 19 degrees Celsius, colonies grew to mean diameters of 22.8 millimetres and accumulated mean biomass of 108.3 milligrams, while at 28 degrees Celsius these values increased substantially to 34.4 millimetres and 329.1 milligrams respectively. Sterigmatocystin, a toxic secondary metabolite produced by the fungus, showed even more dramatic temperature sensitivity: mean production was 3.5 micrograms per gram at 19 degrees Celsius but jumped to 34.5 micrograms per gram at 28 degrees Celsius, with peak production reaching 99 micrograms per gram on one growth medium at the higher temperature. The study also documented that higher temperatures correlated with increased resistance to antifungal agents. Strong positive correlations linked colony diameter to biomass accumulation, diameter to toxin production, and biomass to toxin production, indicating that faster-growing colonies at warmer temperatures also produce more of this toxic compound.  The material conditions of indoor dwelling — temperature regimes shaped by energy policy, climate change projections, and housing standards — directly structure both the metabolic capacity and chemical output of this fungus. The tension between government recommendations to lower indoor temperatures for energy conservation and the simultaneous projection of warming climates creates a volatile ecological niche where Aspergillus creber can shift from a slow-growing, lower-toxin producer to a rapidly proliferating, high-toxin producer. This paper documents how climatic stress and policy-driven dwelling conditions do not simply expose residents to existing fungal hazards, but actively reshape the hazard itself — transforming the organism into a more chemically aggressive form within the very spaces designed for human habitation.",

    "source": "ScienceDirect Publication: Fungal Biology",
    "excerpt": "Fusarium wilt, commonly referred to as Panama disease, stands as the most catastrophic disease in banana cultivation. Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), it has imposed substantial economic burdens on banana farmers worldwide. Foc4-SIX13 was identified as a potential effector in Foc4, and is characterized by secretion into xylem. It is a protein comprised of 312 amino acids, and features a functional signal peptide without recognizable motifs or domains. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the expression of Foc4-SIX13 was markedly upregulated during the initial stage of fungal infection in banana plants. Through homologous recombination, the successful knockout of Foc4-SIX13 was accomplished. The resulting deletion mutant exhibited impaired mycelial growth and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress, coupled with a significant decrease in pathogenicity towards bananas. Foc4-SIX13Δsp could not induce cellular necrosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that Foc4-SIX13Δsp was localized in both cytoplasm and nuclei of N. benthamiana cells. The interaction between Foc4-SIX13 and banana Nudix hydrolase 23 (Ma-NUD23) was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Taken together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Foc4-SIX13 in the pathogenicity of Foc4 and its importance in the Fusarium infection process. Consequently, Foc4-SIX13 is proposed as a promising target for future management strategies against Fusarium wilt, and it can provide a novel avenue for the breeding of banana varieties with enhanced disease resistance.",

This paper identifies Foc4-SIX13, a 312-amino-acid protein secreted into the plant's water-conducting vessels, as a key infection-enabling traits produced by the fungus during early infection. When researchers deleted the gene encoding Foc4-SIX13, the resulting fungal mutant showed reduced growth, heightened vulnerability to osmotic stress, and substantially diminished ability to infect banana plants. The protein localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of plant cells and directly interacts with a banana enzyme called Nudix hydrolase 23, which the fungus appears to target as part of its infection strategy.  The material entanglement documented here reveals how a single fungal protein operates simultaneously as a pathogenic weapon and a point of vulnerability. The same molecular mechanism that enables the fungus to suppress plant defences and establish infection—the hijacking of the banana plant's own enzymatic machinery—also creates a discrete target for breeding disease-resistant banana varieties or developing intervention strategies. What emerges is not simply a pathogen-host relationship but a specific biochemical dependency that could be disrupted, suggesting that understanding the fungus's reliance on particular plant proteins may offer more durable resistance than strategies targeting the fungus alone.",

    "excerpt": "The widespread use of polypropylene-based surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated environmental plastic pollution, necessitating sustainable degradation strategies. This study investigates the biodegradation potential of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus bridgerii on nonwoven polypropylene mask layers under both nutrient-rich (MSM broth) and soil microcosm conditions. A multidisciplinary approach combining weight loss measurements, FTIR-ATR spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize physical, chemical, and biochemical changes in the polymer matrix. Results show that A. bridgerii induced significant degradation in both environments, with the highest weight loss % observed in MSM microcosms (20.38 ± 0.29 %), indicating active fragmentation and partial mineralization. In soil microcosms, fungal inoculation led to the most advanced oxidation (SAUB CI up to ∼4.6), extensive surface fragmentation, and the release of unique volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including DEHP (∼15 % GC-MS area) and long-chain ketones. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by the lowest residual mask mass (9.48 ± 0.19 %), suggesting enhanced mineralization in the nutrient-limited soil. SEM analysis further confirmed pronounced fiber degradation and biofilm formation. These findings underscore the role of fungal metabolism and environmental context in modulating polypropylene decay, supporting a multiple mechanistic process such as oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation. The integration of FTIR, SEM, and GC-MS provided robust evidence of mask polymer degradation and highlights the potential of Aspergillus bridgerii as a bioremediation agent for PPE waste.",

    "summary": "This study documents the capacity of the plant-internal microbe fungus Aspergillus bridgerii to degrade polypropylene nonwoven fabric from surgical masks under controlled laboratory conditions. The fungus achieved a weight loss of 20.38 percent in nutrient-rich broth microcosms and 9.48 percent in soil microcosms, with the soil environment producing more advanced chemical oxidation and the release of volatile organic compounds including diethyl phthalate and long-chain ketones. Physical analysis via scanning electron microscopy revealed pronounced fiber fragmentation and surface-colonising microbial communities on mask surfaces, while infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed chemical transformation of the polymer matrix. The research demonstrates that fungal degradation operates through multiple mechanisms—oxidative fragmentation followed by microbial assimilation—with environmental context (nutrient availability, soil composition) modulating the rate and extent of polymer breakdown.  The findings reveal a material entanglement characteristic of pandemic waste streams: the same fungal metabolism that poses risks in clinical or indoor settings can also function as a decomposition agent for discarded protective equipment. Aspergillus bridgerii's ability to fragment and mineralize polypropylene in soil—where nutrient scarcity paradoxically accelerates degradation—points to how fungal adaptation to resource-limited conditions reshapes synthetic materials into metabolizable growth media. This paper documents not a solution to mask waste but rather a situated ecological process in which a fungal species transforms accumulated pandemic infrastructure into chemical byproducts and fungal biomass, demonstrating how the same organism operates simultaneously as both a potential biological cleanup pathway and a vector of material transformation shaped by the specific chemical and nutritional conditions of its habitat.",

Herein, a green fungal flocculant was developed by cultivating Aspergillus niger using food waste hydrolysate as the sole substrate, achieving a biomass yield of 140.3 mg/g-chemical oxygen demand. Alkaline modification effectively altered surface chemistry by degrading hydrophilic amide groups, enhancing hydrophobicity, surface charge repulsion, and hyphal dispersion. When applied as a coagulant aid with 3% FeCl3, the base-modified fungal flocculant markedly improved sludge dewatering, increasing Dx(90) from 102.0 to 1542.9 μm and reducing specific resistance to filtration by 75.7%, with a final cake water content of 56.8%. Mechanistic analyses revealed that improved fungal network porosity, enhanced hydrophobic interactions, and coordination between fungal functional groups and Fe3+ ions synergistically facilitated water release. This bio-based strategy offers a sustainable alternative that simultaneously valorizes food waste and replaces synthetic polymeric flocculants in sludge treatment.",

    "summary": "Aspergillus niger was cultured on food waste hydrolysate as a growth growth medium, yielding 140.3 milligrams of fungal biomass per gram of chemical oxygen demand. The fungal material was then chemically modified using alkaline treatment, which removed hydrophilic amide groups from the fungal cell surface and increased its water-repelling properties. When this modified fungal material was used alongside ferric chloride in sludge treatment, it substantially improved water removal: the size of dewatered particles increased from 102.0 to 1542.9 micrometers, and the resistance of the sludge to filtration decreased by 75.7%, leaving a final cake with 56.8% water content. This paper attributes the improved performance to three interconnected mechanisms—increased porosity in the fungal network structure, stronger water-repelling interactions at the fungal surface, and chemical bonding between fungal molecules and iron ions.  The fungal flocculant represents a material entanglement characteristic of the Patchy Anthropocene: food waste, typically a marker of surplus and disposal in industrial food systems, becomes growth medium for microbial growth and subsequent valorization as a treatment technology. Yet this transformation does not erase the material dependencies embedded in the process—the fungal flocculant still requires ferric chloride as a coagulant aid, and its efficacy depends on alkaline modification, both chemical interventions that shift rather than eliminate the industrial chemistry of sludge treatment. The fungal biomass thus occupies an ambiguous position: simultaneously a \"green\" alternative to synthetic polymers and a product of the same metabolic and chemical logics that characterize industrial waste management.",

The fungus was modified to overexpress a transporter protein from Aspergillus oryzae that enhances the secretion of malic acid, while adjustments to growth medium conditions further boosted production. The engineered strain successfully metabolized individual lignin-derived aromatic compounds, including 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid, producing up to 3.9 grams of malic acid per litre of culture.

Lignin valorization through fungal conversion reveals a material entanglement characteristic of the Patchy Anthropocene: the same recalcitrant waste stream that accumulates in pulp mills and biorefinery residues becomes, through fungal metabolic engineering, a growth medium for chemical synthesis. The heterogeneity that makes lignin difficult to process conventionally—its variable aromatic composition across plant species and processing methods—becomes, in this fungal system, a feature the organism can navigate rather than an obstacle. What emerges is not simply a cleaner production pathway but a redistribution of economic value: lignin shifts from a low-value byproduct burned for energy to a feedstock for higher-value chemical synthesis, a transformation that depends entirely on the fungus's capacity to metabolize materials humans have struggled to use.",

    "excerpt": "Aflatoxins are highly toxic secondary metabolites widely found in peanut and maize kernels. This study proposes a strategy based on self-supervised learning (SSL) for the accurate detection of Aflatoxin B1 in peanuts and maize. Firstly, an SSL backbone network was constructed to perform a spectral reconstruction task on masked spectra, providing pre-trained weights for subsequent supervised learning. Secondly, the spectral reconstruction error was innovatively used as a wavelength attention mechanism, integrated with the fine-tuned encoder from the SSL stage to develop a classification model. This model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9805 ± 0.0019 in peanuts and 0.9478 ± 0.0060 in maize, outperforming other deep learning models. Furthermore, key wavelengths were selected based on the spectral reconstruction error. Experimental results demonstrated that the 40 selected key wavelengths outperformed other methods, with a more uniform distribution, capturing richer spectral features. The strategy in this study provides an efficient solution for few-sample spectral detection.",

    "summary": "Aflatoxin B1, a toxic compound produced by certain moulds, accumulates in peanut and maize kernels and poses significant food safety risks. This paper develops a detection method using self-supervised learning on spectral data—a machine learning approach where a neural network first learns patterns from unlabeled spectral measurements by reconstructing masked portions of spectra, then applies this knowledge to classify whether aflatoxin B1 is present. The method achieved detection accuracy of 98.05 per cent in peanuts and 94.78 per cent in maize, surpassing other deep learning approaches tested. The researchers identified 40 key wavelengths of light that carry the most diagnostic information about aflatoxin presence, selected through analysis of reconstruction errors from the self-supervised stage.  The detection apparatus itself—spectral measurement of grain kernels—operates at the intersection of agricultural commodity flows and toxin surveillance. Aflatoxin B1 emerges here not merely as a pathogenic metabolite requiring elimination, but as a detectable material signature embedded in grain destined for human and animal consumption. The method's efficiency with limited training samples suggests potential deployment in contexts where grain testing infrastructure remains sparse or where rapid screening of high-volume commodity batches is economically necessary. Yet the technology's capacity to identify contaminated grain also depends on access to spectral scanning equipment and computational resources, making detection itself a distributed capacity shaped by capital investment in agricultural supply chains rather than a neutral technical capability.",

    "excerpt": "Mycotoxin contamination of food and feed is a lingering issue of the global agro-food industries and a matter of severe socio-economic concern. Several methods have been conventionally employed for mycotoxin decontamination but their efficiency remained low and insufficient due to robustness of mycotoxin structures. In this article, use of unconventional technologies like irradiation, ozonation, cold activated plasma, magnetic nanoparticles, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, pulsed light, natural essential oils and phytochemicals in controlling growth of toxigenic fungi and degrading mycotoxins in various foodstuffs have been reviewed. The efficacy of decontamination of different types of major mycotoxins by these novel techniques and the associated safety and limitation factors have been analysed and discussed in detail. Combination of different unconventional techniques and impact of techno-economic-environmental aspects associated with these advanced technologies on their adoption and implementation at large scale to achieve a green and sustainable control of mycotoxins have been highlighted.",

    "summary": "This paper surveys decontamination methods for mycotoxins in food and feed, comparing conventional approaches with emerging technologies. The conventional techniques addressed in this review have proven inadequate because mycotoxin molecules are structurally resistant to degradation. The unconventional technologies examined include irradiation, ozonation, cold activated plasma, magnetic nanoparticles, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, pulsed light, natural essential oils, and phytochemicals—all evaluated for their capacity to inhibit toxigenic fungi growth and break down mycotoxins across different food commodities. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of these novel techniques against major mycotoxin types, alongside their safety profiles and practical limitations. The review also considers combinations of multiple unconventional techniques and assesses the technical, economic, and environmental factors that determine whether these advanced technologies can be scaled up for large-scale implementation.  Within food systems shaped by global trade and storage infrastructure, mycotoxin contamination emerges as both a persistent hazard requiring technological intervention and a site where novel decontamination methods generate new dependencies and costs. The shift from conventional to unconventional technologies—from simple physical removal to plasma activation and nanoparticle deployment—reveals how food safety increasingly depends on energy-intensive, capital-heavy systems whose adoption remains uneven across regions and commodity chains. The paper's attention to techno-economic-environmental trade-offs suggests that no single decontamination method resolves the underlying material problem; instead, the choice of technique redistributes risk and resource demand across different stages of production and storage.",

    "excerpt": "Food contamination with mycotoxins poses a serious threat to human and animal health. Traditional chromatographic methods and rapid detection techniques are widely used for accurate quantification and on-site rapid screening, respectively, and play essential roles in food safety monitoring. However, these approaches still face limitations arising from cumbersome sample pretreatment and matrix effects. Affinity magnetic beads (AMBs), which integrate highly specific recognition elements with magnetic carriers, represent a promising solution owing to their strong enrichment capability, good dispersibility, soften matrix effects, and high compatibility with automated systems. This review discusses the structure, working principles, and applications of AMBs employing antibodies, aptamers, and molecularly imprinted polymers as recognition elements. It also evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of both chromatographic and rapid detection methods. Finally, the review highlights current challenges and future perspectives for the application of AMBs in mycotoxin detection.",

    "summary": "This review examines affinity magnetic beads as tools for detecting mycotoxins in food. The beads work by combining recognition molecules—antibodies, aptamers, or molecularly imprinted polymers—with magnetic carriers to isolate and concentrate mycotoxins from food samples. According to this paper, affinity magnetic beads address persistent problems in mycotoxin detection: they reduce the labour-intensive sample preparation steps that precede analysis, diminish interference from other food components, and integrate readily with automated detection systems. The review evaluates how these beads enhance both traditional chromatographic methods and rapid on-site screening techniques, assessing their capacity to improve detection sensitivity and accuracy across different recognition chemistries.  Within food systems shaped by storage conditions, labour constraints, and capital investment in safety infrastructure, affinity magnetic beads represent a technical intervention that simultaneously reveals and obscures the material conditions of contamination. The beads make mycotoxin detection faster and more automated, yet this efficiency depends on their ability to selectively bind and remove toxins that accumulate precisely because of the economic pressures—inadequate storage facilities, moisture control, and supply chain monitoring—that characterize food production in many regions. Detection technology thus becomes a proxy for managing risk rather than addressing the structural vulnerabilities that allow fungal proliferation and toxin accumulation in the first place.",

    "excerpt": "Glucose oxidase (GOX EC.1.1.3.4) specifically catalyzes the reaction of β-d-glucose to gluconic acid in an oxygen-consuming process, enabling its antimicrobial potential. However, the unstable nature and insufficient activity of the FAD-dependent dimer hinder the antibacterial capacity. In this study, A GOX from Aspergillus eucalypticola (AeGOXL), outstanding for its catalytic efficiency, was selected for laboratory evolution through random mutagenesis. Three thermostable variants Q148K, H283Y, and P514K were selected and form the combined variant Q148K/H283Y (M1), superior in both thermostability (T50 increased 13 °C, Tm increased 6.7 °C, and 2.1-fold of t1/2 prolonged at 80 °C) and catalytic activity (97% and 57% increase in specific activity and kcat/Km), comparing with the WT. Structural investigations elucidated the molecular stabilization due to additional hydrogen bond network formation, while long-range interaction elevated the flexibility of key residues, improving the substrate affinity. For antibacterial capacity, M1 significantly brought down the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli separately to 21.3 and 17.4 mg/L (52.5% and 70.5% lower than the WT, comparable to sensitive conventional antibiotics), in accordance with the electron microscope manifestation.

The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose to gluconic acid in an oxygen-dependent reaction. A combined variant carrying three mutations (Q148K/H283Y, designated M1) demonstrated superior thermal stability—with a 13 degree Celsius increase in the temperature at which half the enzyme denatures, a 6.7 degree Celsius increase in melting temperature, and a 2.1-fold extension of half-life at 80 degrees Celsius—alongside a 97 percent increase in specific activity and a 57 percent increase in catalytic efficiency compared to the unmodified enzyme. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations created additional hydrogen bonding networks and altered the flexibility of critical amino acid positions, enhancing how effectively the enzyme binds its growth medium. The engineered variant reduced the concentration required to inhibit growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli to 21.3 and 17.4 milligrams per litre respectively—52.5 percent and 70.5 percent lower than the unmodified enzyme—with potency comparable to conventional antibiotics, as confirmed by electron microscopy.  The stabilization of this fungal enzyme reveals a material entanglement characteristic of antimicrobial development in the Anthropocene: the same organism engineered for antibacterial capacity depends on molecular modifications that alter its fundamental biochemistry, creating a tool whose efficacy is inseparable from its engineered fragility.

GC-MS analysis confirmed consistent chemical composition across production batches. In vitro, LEO exhibited potent antifungal activity against A. alternata (IC₅₀, 0.0718 μL/mL), while in vivo experiments on tomato fruit showed it significantly inhibited lesion expansion and suppressed the accumulation of mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and tenuazonic acid (TeA). SEM, TEM, proteomic, and physiological analyses revealed that LEO disrupted membrane integrity, interfered with energy metabolism, and induced oxidative stress, suggesting multi-target antifungal mechanisms. Acute toxicity in mice confirmed its safety. These findings support the application of LEO as a promising natural preservative for postharvest disease and toxin control in tomatoes.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the chemical composition remained consistent across production batches. The essential oil demonstrated strong antifungal activity against A. alternata in laboratory conditions (with a concentration needed to inhibit 50 percent of fungal growth at 0.0718 microliters per milliliter), and when applied to tomato fruit, it reduced the size of decay lesions and lowered levels of two mycotoxins produced by the fungus: alternariol and tenuazonic acid. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, protein analysis, and physiological measurements showed the essential oil worked through multiple mechanisms—damaging the fungal cell membrane, disrupting energy production, and triggering oxidative stress—and toxicity testing in mice confirmed its safety for use.  Within postharvest tomato storage, the essential oil emerges as both a remediation technology and a material dependency. The fungus itself—capable of rapid adaptation and toxin production under the stresses of storage conditions—becomes simultaneously a threat to commodity value and a driver of the demand for botanical interventions. The extraction method's efficiency gain (3.38-fold yield improvement) reveals how intensified control strategies depend on optimized material processing, embedding agricultural preservation within broader patterns of resource extraction and chemical intensification, even as the intervention is marketed as natural and eco-friendly.",

    "excerpt": "A hyperglycemic condition, characterized by high glucose concentration in the bloodstream, is one of the most potent dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). It regulates the response to oxidative stress, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, as well as affects the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which plays a pivotal role in protecting against chemicals and contaminants present in the diet. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and alternariol (AOH) are quite well-known, no research so far has considered the possibility that high glucose concentration might affect the response of CRC cells to mycotoxins. In this study, we evaluated how high glucose condition (50 mmol/L) modulates the effect of two mycotoxins distinct in toxicity and underlying mechanisms: DON (0.1–1 μmol/L) and AOH (0.1–20 μmol/L). We evaluated the migration and invasion in Caco-2 and HT-29 CRC cell lines, impact on barrier integrity and metabolism of mycotoxins in an intestinal in vitro co-culture model comprising Caco-2/HT-29-MTX-E12/CCD-18Co. Our results showed that high glucose concentration indeed modulates the response of CRC cells to mycotoxins, affecting their metabolism and altering the cellular sensitivity towards them. This observation shed new light on the importance of the involvement of different physiological and pathological conditions when considering the toxicity of mycotoxins. • AOH and DON modulate glucose receptors expression in CRC cells. • AOH and DON affect the migration and invasiveness of CRC cells. • High glucose modulates the effect of AOH and DON on CRC invasiveness. • High glucose increases AOH and DON- modulated intestinal integrity. • High glucose affects AOH metabolism as well as AOH and DON recovery.",

    "summary": "This paper evaluated how elevated blood glucose concentration alters colon cancer cell responses to two fungal toxins: deoxynivalenol and alternariol. The study exposed two colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) to high glucose conditions (50 millimoles per litre) combined with deoxynivalenol (0.1–1 micromoles per litre) or alternariol (0.1–20 micromoles per litre), measuring changes in cell migration, invasion, and barrier function. The toxins modulated expression of glucose receptors on cancer cells and altered their invasive behaviour. High glucose conditions changed how cancer cells responded to both mycotoxins, affecting cellular sensitivity and the rate at which cells metabolized alternariol. The study also demonstrated that elevated glucose increased intestinal barrier integrity in the presence of these toxins, contrary to what might be expected from glucose's known role as a cancer risk factor.  Within the material assemblages of the human gut, hyperglycemia and fungal toxins do not act as independent threats but rather as co-constitutive forces that reshape cellular vulnerability and metabolic capacity. The finding that high glucose simultaneously increases barrier protection while modulating cancer cell invasiveness reveals the contradictory material logic of metabolic dysregulation—a condition that accelerates cancer risk through one pathway while triggering compensatory responses through another. This suggests that the toxicological profile of mycotoxins cannot be isolated from the physiological states they encounter; their effects emerge from the specific metabolic terrain they inhabit, one increasingly shaped by industrial food systems that deliver both refined carbohydrates and fungal contaminants to the same vulnerable tissues.",

    "excerpt": "To explore transglycosidase application potential in starch processing and baking, a <i>Bacillus inaquosorum</i> strain with high amylopectin debranching activity was isolated and identified from the soil. Its neopullulanase gene (<i>Binp</i>) was cloned and heterologously expressed in <i><i>Escherichia coli</i></i> BL21. The recombinant enzyme reBinp, which requires a metal ion, had optimal catalytic activity at 35 °C and pH 7.0, efficiently hydrolyzed α-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds. Synergistic hydrolysis and transglycosylation effects were displayed when reBinp acted with <i><i>Aspergillus niger</i></i> α-transglucosidase (Antg). Adding reBinp and Antg (each of 1000 U/kg wheat flour) significantly improved bread quality and increased specific volume, hardness, gumminess, chewiness, cohesiveness, and storage stability. Mechanistically, the mixed enzymes decreased the relative crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of dough to 14.5% and 3.95 mJ/mg, respectively, while increasing the FTIR <i>R</i><sub>1047/1022</sub> ratio to 1.70.

The recombinant enzyme required metal ions to function, worked optimally at 35 degrees Celsius and neutral pH, and specifically cleaved the branching bonds in starch. When combined with an enzyme from the mould *Aspergillus niger*, the two enzymes worked combined-effect: adding both enzymes at 1000 units per kilogram of wheat flour improved bread volume, texture firmness, and shelf stability. The mixed enzymes altered the physical structure of dough by reducing starch crystallinity to 14.5 percent and lowering the energy required for starch gelatinization to 3.95 millijoules per milligram.  Within industrial bread production, this research documents the material entanglement between bacterial and fungal enzymatic labour—two organisms from radically different ecological niches now coordinated to transform starch structure and extend product shelf life. The combined-effect effect reveals how microbial metabolic capacities become economically valuable not in isolation but through deliberate pairing, turning soil microbes into precision tools for manipulating the physical properties of a staple carbohydrate.

However, recent outbreaks have been reported in outpatient settings, following epidural injections with contaminated medicines. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies published without date restrictions through July 2025 on ICNSMIs. We identified 905 cases of such infections, with 4% occurring in non-outbreak settings and 96% associated with five documented outbreaks. In both non-outbreak and outbreak settings, infections were more common after spinal/epidural injections, with contaminated medicines or supplies being the primary source. Due to their angioinvasive tendencies, ICNSMI caused by Fusarium solani and Aspergillus species had a higher frequency of stroke/intracranial hemorrhage ( P = 0.011), aneurysm formation ( P = 0.012), and resulted in higher mortality compared with ICNSMI caused by other molds ( P &lt; 0.001). ICNSMI, as a result of catheter-associated fungemia, was very rare (only one case). Strategies to identify ICNSMI in exposed individuals during an outbreak have included (i) symptom-driven lumbar puncture, (ii) screening lumbar puncture regardless of symptoms, and (iii) screening brain MRI regardless of symptoms. Measurement of (1→3)-β-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid was a valuable tool to diagnose ICNSMI preemptively. Outcomes of ICNSMI following neurosurgical procedures were poor (90-day mortality of 35%) and depended on the route of inoculation, mold species, timing of diagnosis, and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy in combination with source control. Patients with ICNSMI often suffered long-term neurologic sequelae, even with the most optimal management strategies.",

    "summary": "Iatrogenic central nervous system mold infections occur predominantly in outbreak settings, with this paper identifying 905 documented cases across the literature, of which 96% were associated with five major outbreaks and only 4% occurred sporadically. The infections resulted from contaminated medicines or medical supplies introduced during spinal and epidural injections rather than from catheter-associated fungemia, which accounted for only a single case. Fusarium solani and Aspergillus species demonstrated higher angioinvasive capacity than other molds, leading to significantly elevated rates of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and aneurysm formation, alongside substantially higher mortality. Measurement of a fungal cell wall component in cerebrospinal fluid proved effective for early diagnosis, and outcomes depended critically on the mold species involved, timing of diagnosis, and rapid initiation of antifungal treatment combined with source control, though 90-day mortality following neurosurgical procedures reached 35% and survivors frequently experienced lasting neurological damage.  These outbreaks reveal how medical interventions designed to relieve pain or treat neurological conditions become vectors for mold colonization when supply chains fail—a pattern shaped by the material vulnerabilities of injectable medicines and the difficulty of maintaining sterility across distributed outpatient networks. The same Aspergillus and Fusarium species that pose clinical threats also expose the fragility of contemporary medical infrastructure; their capacity to invade blood vessels and cause hemorrhage within the nervous system transforms a contamination event into a cascade of vascular rupture and tissue death, making outbreak response dependent not only on clinical vigilance but on the ability to trace contaminated batches backward through supply chains and forward into exposed populations.",

    "title": "Contribution of terrestrial processes in reducing environmental mycotoxin levels: a review on mycotoxin-soil interactions",
    "source": "Latest Results",
    "excerpt": "Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that can harm humans and animals. They occur primarily in infected crops, with higher levels under environmental stress. Their origin in contaminated crops is the main contributor to soil contamination. Although high levels can be detected in soils, these are transitory and in average far lower than in contaminated crops, indicating a key role of functioning soils in down-regulating environmental mycotoxin levels. This review examines mycotoxin-soil interactions in terms of four terrestrial processes: (i) adsorption to soil fractions, (ii) microbial transformation and mineralisation (iii) transport/mobilization with water, (iv) plant uptake and response. Results show that the main process for dissipation in soils is microbial, improved by biomass and activity and by a narrow fungi-to-bacteria ratio. This aligns with incubation studies suggesting a key role of bacteria in the degradation of mycotoxins. This path is favoured by the availability of the mycotoxins, that can be reduced by the adsorption to soil particles: the aromatic character and the carbonyl functions are decisive for adsorption to soil organic matter and clay particles, respectively. Consequently, mycotoxin levels in environmental compartments can be interpreted as the (net) result of entry and dissipation processes mediated through the soil, rather than the soil acting as a source of them. Plant uptake represents a minor pathway of contamination compared to the in situ production. In soil-plant systems, suboptimal nitrogen (N) and pesticide management are factors triggering fungal infestation and mycotoxins levels. Fungal infestation and mycotoxin can induce the polyphenolic response of the plant, along with mycotoxin metabolization as reported for DON. Based on this newly-made interpretation, this review provides future perspectives on mycotoxin occurrence and fate under climate change and intensive agriculture and proposes soil-based strategies for an integral env",

    "summary": "Soils function as active filters that reduce environmental mycotoxin levels rather than amplifying them, according to this review. The paper identifies four terrestrial processes mediating mycotoxin fate: binding to soil particles, microbial breakdown and complete mineralization, movement through water, and uptake by plants. Microbial degradation emerges as the dominant dissipation pathway, with bacterial activity playing a central role—a process enhanced by greater microbial biomass and a narrow ratio of fungi to bacteria in the soil community. The chemical structure of mycotoxins determines their behavior: aromatic compounds bind preferentially to soil organic matter, while those containing carbonyl groups attach to clay particles, reducing their availability for further transport or uptake. Plant uptake of mycotoxins from soil represents a minor contamination route compared to direct fungal infection of crops during growth.  Environmental mycotoxin levels thus reflect a balance between entry from contaminated crops and active removal through soil processes, not soil as a source of toxins. Under conditions of suboptimal nitrogen management and pesticide use, plants become more susceptible to fungal infection and mycotoxin accumulation, yet simultaneously mount defensive responses—including the production of protective compounds and metabolic transformation of some mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol. This reveals soil not as inert growth medium but as a working system where microbial communities and plant physiology together regulate the fate of fungal poisons, with implications for how agricultural intensification and climate pressures reshape these mediating relationships.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are common and often fatal in severe burn patients due to skin barrier loss and immune dysfunction. However, current definitions of invasive mold infections are poorly adapted to this population. This study evaluated the characteristics of various diagnostic criteria and their combinations in relation to clinical outcomes in burn patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Burn ICU from 2014 to 2023 with ≥15% total burn surface area and at least one sample sent to the mycology lab. Criteria included direct microscopy, culture (respiratory, skin, or tissue), species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Aspergillus , Mucorales, and Fusarium ) on plasma/tissue/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum galactomannan. Among 276 patients, 489/6,184 samples were positive, including 281 skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) and 132 plasma specimens (qPCR). Positive diagnostic criteria ≥1 was found in 93 patients (33.7%): Aspergillus (25.7%), Mucorales (10.9%), and Fusarium (9.8%). Twenty-seven patients (9.8%) had ≥2 criteria involving ≥2 mold types. Mortality rose with the number of positive criteria: 12.7% (0), 10.7% (1, 2), 27.3% (3, 4), and 46.7% (≥5) ( P &lt; 0.001). Plasma qPCR was positive in 81.3% of Mucorales, 40% of Aspergillus , and 15.4% of Fusarium cases with skin involvement. Skin biopsies (direct examination and conventional culture) combined with species-specific plasma qPCR enhance timely and reliable IFD diagnosis in burn patients. Mortality correlated with the number of positive criteria and coexistence of multiple mold species, underscoring the need for broad antifungal coverage and the value of multi-criteria diagnostics to guide treatment.

    "summary": "Severe burn patients with damaged skin and impaired immune function frequently develop invasive mold infections, yet diagnostic criteria designed for other patient populations do not reliably identify these infections in this group. This paper evaluated how different diagnostic methods—direct microscopy of tissue samples, fungal culture from respiratory secretions and skin biopsies, species-specific genetic detection in blood and tissue samples, and serum galactomannan testing—performed in 276 burn patients admitted between 2014 and 2023 with burns covering at least 15 percent of total body surface area. Among 6,184 samples tested, 489 were positive for mold; skin biopsies yielded 281 positive results while blood tests detected 132 positive results. Ninety-three patients (33.7 percent) showed at least one positive diagnostic criterion, with Aspergillus detected in 25.7 percent of patients, Mucorales in 10.9 percent, and Fusarium in 9.8 percent. Patient mortality increased sharply with the number of positive diagnostic criteria detected: 12.7 percent mortality with no positive criteria, 10.7 percent with one or two criteria, 27.3 percent with three or four criteria, and 46.7 percent with five or more criteria. The paper notes that genetic detection in blood was most sensitive for Mucorales (81.3 percent of cases with skin involvement), moderately sensitive for Aspergillus (40 percent), and least sensitive for Fusarium (15.4 percent).  Within burn units, molds simultaneously mark clinical deterioration and reveal the material vulnerabilities of severely injured bodies—the compromised skin barrier and suppressed immune response create conditions where multiple mold species can establish simultaneous infections. The escalating mortality tied to cumulative positive diagnostic criteria suggests that the presence of multiple molds is not incidental but constitutive of a particular state of bodily breakdown in which burn injury has created a permissive growth medium for fungal colonization. The diagnostic challenge documented here reflects a deeper entanglement: the same diagnostic tools designed to detect pathogenic molds in other contexts must be recalibrated for burn patients, where the ecology of infection is fundamentally altered by trauma and where clinical outcomes depend not on detecting a single pathogen but on recognizing the assemblage of multiple fungal species that exploit the same damaged tissues.",

    "source": "Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Abstract BACKGROUND Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ), a potent mycotoxin frequently detected in improperly stored poultry feed, induces hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and growth retardation in broilers. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa , exhibits strong antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities; however, its efficacy and mechanisms in mitigating AFB 1 ‐induced hepatotoxicity in broilers remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary CUR supplementation on growth performance and liver health of broilers exposed to AFB 1 . RESULTS A total of 720 broilers (eight replicates of 15 birds each per treatment) were fed a basal diet, an AFB₁‐contaminated diet (1 mg kg −1 ), or AFB 1 diets supplemented with CUR (100, 300, or 500 mg kg −1 ) for 42 days. AFB 1 exposure significantly reduced average daily gain and increased feed conversion ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas CUR supplementation – particularly 300–500 mg kg −1 – improved growth performance relative to the AFB 1 group ( P &lt; 0.05). CUR also decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, alleviated hepatic histopathological damage, enhanced hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), and suppressed malondialdehyde accumulation ( P &lt; 0.01). At the molecular level, CUR upregulated Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes while downregulating NOD‐like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase‐1, and interleukin‐1β, indicating attenuation of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Dietary curcumin effectively mitigated AFB 1 ‐induced hepatotoxicity and performance loss in broilers through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

    "summary": "Aflatoxin B1, a mycotoxin commonly found in poorly stored poultry feed, damages broiler livers by triggering oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing weight gain and worsening feed conversion efficiency. This paper tested whether curcumin, a plant compound from turmeric with known antioxidant properties, could protect broilers from this toxin. Over 42 days, 720 broilers received either standard feed, feed contaminated with aflatoxin B1 at 1 milligram per kilogram, or contaminated feed supplemented with curcumin at 100, 300, or 500 milligrams per kilogram. Aflatoxin B1 alone reduced daily weight gain and increased the amount of feed needed per unit of growth; curcumin at 300–500 milligrams per kilogram reversed these effects. At the tissue level, curcumin lowered liver enzyme markers of damage, reduced scarring and cell death in liver tissue, boosted protective enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and reduced harmful oxidative byproducts. Molecularly, curcumin activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 antioxidant pathway and suppressed the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome—a cellular trigger for inflammatory cell death—by reducing caspase-1 and interleukin-1 beta.  Within contaminated feed systems, curcumin emerges as both a remedial intervention and a marker of deeper structural vulnerabilities. The same storage failures that generate aflatoxin B1 as a byproduct of mould growth in feed warehouses create the conditions requiring chemical mitigation; curcumin does not address the material conditions—moisture, temperature, ventilation—that allow toxin-producing moulds to proliferate in the first place. Rather, this paper documents how a natural additive can be layered into industrial poultry production to manage exposure without altering the infrastructural arrangements that make such exposure routine. The efficacy of curcumin thus depends on, and reinforces, a system where mycotoxin contamination is treated as an inevitable cost absorbed through supplementation rather than prevented through transformed storage practices.",

    "excerpt": "Peanut root rot (PRR), caused by <i>Fusarium solani</i>, is a common and destructive disease. Cyclobutrifluram exhibits antifungal activity against <i>Fusarium</i> spp., yet its bioactivity and resistance risk against <i>F. solani</i> remain unclear. In this study, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of cyclobutrifluram against 155 <i>F. solani</i> strains ranged from 0.0279 to 0.1102 μg/mL, with a mean of 0.0513 ± 0.0170 μg/mL. Treatment with cyclobutrifluram significantly inhibited conidial production and germination, reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, increased hyphal branching, and shortened the distance between septa or cell nuclei. Cyclobutrifluram provided excellent control over PRR. Seven laboratory-generated cyclobutrifluram-resistant mutants showed no or slight fitness penalties and exhibited positive cross-resistance only with pydiflumetofen, indicating a moderate-to-high resistance risk. Resistance to cyclobutrifluram in <i>F. solani</i> was conferred by four SDH substitutions (<i>FsSdhB</i><sup>H248Y</sup>, <i>FsSdhC1</i><sup>A83V</sup>, <i>FsSdhC2</i><sup>A85V</sup>, and <i>FsSdhD</i><sup>D184G</sup>), which was confirmed by molecular docking and gene replacement.

    "summary": "This paper documents the antifungal potency of cyclobutrifluram against *Fusarium solani*, the fungus responsible for peanut root rot, across 155 field-collected strains. The drug inhibited spore production and germination, disrupted the fungus's energy metabolism by reducing succinate dehydrogenase activity, and altered hyphal structure by increasing branching and compressing the spacing between cell compartments. Cyclobutrifluram delivered effective disease control in peanut crops. However, the study identified a significant liability: seven laboratory-generated resistant mutants emerged without substantial fitness costs and showed cross-resistance to pydiflumetofen, signalling moderate-to-high risk of resistance development in field populations. Genetic analysis pinpointed four specific mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex that confer resistance, confirmed through molecular modelling and experimental gene replacement.  The tension embedded in this finding reflects a familiar pattern in agricultural chemical control: a potent tool for managing crop disease simultaneously creates the conditions for its own obsolescence. The same metabolic target that makes cyclobutrifluram effective—the succinate dehydrogenase complex—proves vulnerable to rapid genetic adaptation in *Fusarium solani*, with resistant mutants bearing no apparent survival cost. This decoupling of resistance from fitness penalty suggests that once resistance emerges in peanut fields, it will persist and spread unchecked, transforming cyclobutrifluram from a solution into a driver of fungal adaptation. The moderate-to-high resistance risk documented here reflects not a flaw in the molecule but a structural feature of intensive monoculture agriculture: the reliance on single-target fungicides in environments where fungal populations are large, genetically diverse, and under constant chemical pressure.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "summary": "Aspergillus fumigatus isolates collected in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2022 showed a rising prevalence of azole resistance, with 34 distinct genetic variants identified in the cyp51A gene. This paper examined how individual genetic variations and combinations of variations in this gene affect resistance to four azole antifungal drugs. The researchers used computer modelling to predict how amino acid changes would alter the structure of the Cyp51A protein, then introduced these mutations into laboratory strains using genetic editing technology and measured how resistant the resulting fungi were to azoles. Strains carrying multiple mutations together showed substantially higher resistance levels than unmutated strains, particularly to voriconazole and isavuconazole, though the most heavily mutated strain remained susceptible to itraconazole despite carrying the TR34 resistance marker.  The pattern documented here reveals how a pathogenic fungus generates pharmaceutical resistance not as a binary outcome but as a graduated response shaped by the specific combination of genetic changes present. The same mutations that render this organism clinically intractable in one drug context can leave it vulnerable in another, creating a fragmented landscape of therapeutic options that depends entirely on which particular mutations accumulate in which individual isolate. This conditional resistance—where a single fungal strain's susceptibility profile shifts across the azole drug class—reflects how microbial adaptation to medical intervention produces not uniform danger but distributed and uneven vulnerability, a pattern that will shape clinical decision-making and drug availability differently across different patient populations and treatment contexts.",

    "source": "acs: ACS Omega: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a trichothecene mycotoxin from <i>Fusarium</i> species that contaminates cereal grains, posing health risks. DON binds to site A of the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotes, triggering a ribotoxic stress response. Despite structural similarity, its metabolites, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) and 3-<i>epi</i>-deoxynivalenol (3-<i>epi</i>-DON), are nontoxic, but the molecular basis of this difference is unclear. This study employed molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum chemical calculations based on Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) to analyze the interactions of DON and its metabolites with the ribosomal site. Our results reveal that DON adopts a unique binding conformation, enabling strong and stable interactions with an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and nucleotide U2873, maintaining its position within the ribosomal pocket throughout 500 ns of MD simulations. In contrast, DOM-1 and 3-<i>epi</i>-DON fail to sustain these interactions due to the absence of the epoxide group or altered hydroxyl orientation, leading to their dissociation. Additional MD simulations of the complex with another potent toxic trichothecene, verrucarin A showed stable binding at the same site, emphasizing the importance of these molecular interactions for toxicity. Further, quantum chemical analyses highlighted the energetic contributions of electrostatic and induction forces in stabilizing DON within the binding pocket. These data are in line with experimental studies in HCT116 human colon cancer cells confirming the lack of cytotoxicity of DOM-1 and 3-<i>epi</i>-DON and demonstrating differential ribotoxicity of DON and its metabolites.

    "summary": "Deoxynivalenol, a poisonous compound produced by *Fusarium* fungi that contaminates cereal grains, binds tightly to a specific site on the 60S ribosomal subunit and triggers a cellular stress response in eukaryotes. This paper used computational methods—molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations lasting 500 nanoseconds, and quantum chemical calculations—to explain why DON causes harm while its chemically similar metabolites, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol and 3-*epi*-deoxynivalenol (3-*epi*-DON), do not. The analysis revealed that DON maintains stable binding to the ribosomal pocket through strong interactions with a magnesium ion and a specific nucleotide, whereas DOM-1 and 3-*epi*-DON cannot sustain these interactions because they lack DON's epoxide group or have altered hydroxyl group positioning, causing them to dissociate from the binding site. The quantum chemical analysis identified electrostatic and induction forces as the primary energetic drivers stabilizing DON at the ribosomal site. Testing in human colon cancer cells confirmed that DOM-1 and 3-*epi*-DON lack toxicity while DON retains its capacity to trigger the ribotoxic stress response, establishing a clear relationship between molecular structure and toxic effect.  The findings document how minor chemical modifications—the presence or absence of a single epoxide group, the spatial orientation of a hydroxyl group—determine whether a trichothecene molecule becomes a cellular poison or an inert metabolite. This structural specificity reveals the material precision required for toxicity, yet simultaneously exposes a vulnerability: the very chemical features that make DON dangerous also define the pathways through which it might be neutralized or transformed. The paper thus maps both the mechanism of harm and, implicitly, the chemical logic by which grain-contaminating fungi and their toxins might be rendered harmless through targeted molecular intervention.",

Compound 1 (N-(2-methyl-3-oxodec-8-enoyl)-2-pyrroline) demonstrated pesticidal potency, killing 100 percent of larvae of the diamondback moth *Plutella xylostella* within five days at 5 millimolar concentration, outperforming the commercial pesticide diflubenzuron. The researchers identified and characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for producing compound 1, demonstrating that a cytochrome P450 enzyme (PasB) catalyzes the final chemical transformation—converting an intermediate compound into the active 3-pyrroline form through removal of a hydroxymethyl group and addition of a double bond.  Within the material entanglements of marine fungal chemistry and pest control, this paper reveals how a single fungal strain becomes simultaneously a source of bioactive molecules and a site for understanding insecticidal mechanisms. The structural features that make these alkaloids effective against insect chitinase—the very enzyme that allows insects to build their exoskeletons—also mark them as products of fungal metabolic pathways shaped by competition in marine sediments. The optimization of compound 1 for pesticidal use thus depends on understanding not just its target in the insect body, but the fungal enzymatic machinery that evolved to produce it, collapsing the distinction between natural product and synthetic pesticide into a shared biosynthetic logic.",

    "summary": "The source abstract describes development of an analytical method to detect 15 different mycotoxins produced by three fungal genera—Fusarium, Alternaria, and Aspergillus—in plant-based meat, cheese, and fish substitutes. This paper adapted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to simultaneously measure these toxins, which include deoxynivalenol and its derivatives, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and sterigmatocystin, among others. The method employed a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction approach followed by dispersive solid phase extraction for sample cleanup and stable isotope dilution analysis for quantification. Detection limits ranged from 0.01 micrograms per kilogram for some aflatoxins and sterigmatocystin to 14.1 micrograms per kilogram for deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, with quantification limits between 0.02 and 41.9 micrograms per kilogram across the 15 toxins measured.  The expansion of plant-based protein markets creates new sites where fungal metabolites accumulate and require monitoring—yet the choice of which toxins to measure, and at what detection thresholds, reflects prior regulatory and commercial decisions rather than comprehensive microbial ecology. This paper's focus on plant-based alternatives reveals a material dependency: as animal agriculture is displaced by crop-based substitutes, the fungal contaminants embedded in grain and legume supply chains become newly visible and newly regulated, shifting but not eliminating exposure pathways shaped by agricultural intensification and global commodity flows.",

    "excerpt": "Abstract Numerous approaches for the solution‐based fabrication of chitosan‐based materials are reported, but most often result in materials with limitations in terms of stability in aqueous systems and mechanics unless chemical cross‐linking is utilized. In the present study, a thermomechanical compression method is presented for solid‐state processing of chitosan powders into dense bulk plastic‐like materials where the mechanical and physical properties can be tailored. To achieve this outcome, chitosan‐citrate complexes, formed through ionic cross‐linking and amidation, undergo thermal fusion at high temperature and pressure to generate robust materials with retention of the inherent properties of chitosan, including biodegradability and cytocompatibility. The chitosan‐based plastics can be doped with enzymes and antibiotics with retention of bioactivity and are also explored as living materials when microbial cells (e.g., Pseudomonas putida ) are included in the process and subsequently shown to maintain metabolic functions to degrade organic pollutants. This thermoplastic approach for solid‐state processing of chitosan enables the development of a variety of new materials and composites with embedded biomolecules for enhanced functions. This solid‐state fabrication of chitosan bulk materials approach eliminates the need for conventional solution‐based processing, enabling rapid material production via compression molding while reducing costs, minimizing waste, and improving overall manufacturing efficiency.",

    "summary": "Chitosan powders can be transformed into dense plastic-like materials through thermomechanical compression—heating and pressing chitosan-citrate complexes at high temperature and pressure to create robust solids that retain the original polymer's biodegradability and capacity to support cell growth. This paper demonstrates that the resulting plastics maintain mechanical and physical properties suitable for practical use without requiring chemical cross-linking agents. The materials can be loaded with enzymes and antibiotics while preserving their biological activity, and when inoculated with bacterial cells such as *Pseudomonas putida*, the embedded microorganisms remain metabolically active and capable of breaking down organic pollutants. The solid-state compression approach reduces manufacturing complexity and waste compared to traditional solution-based methods, enabling faster production at lower cost.  Within the material transformations of the Anthropocene, this work reveals a productive tension: chitosan itself—derived from shellfish waste streams—becomes a plastic substitute that can simultaneously host living degradative capacity. The bacterial cells embedded in the material matrix are neither passive fillers nor contaminants but functional agents whose metabolic labour transforms the composite into a remediation technology. Yet this embedding of microbial work within manufactured solids also represents a new form of biological capture and control, where the capacity of living systems to process pollutants is fixed into industrial form and extracted as a material property rather than emerging from autonomous ecological relations.",

    "excerpt": "The consumption of tea as a beverage is considerably increasing worldwide. However, some questions are raised about its safety, particularly regarding the potential contamination by mycotoxins. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the overall prevalence of mycotoxin contamination in different types of tea (black, green, dark, white and pu-erh), to compare the contamination rate between two periods (2000–2017 and 2018–2022), and to investigate the impact of country’s income on this contamination. Included studies were selected from Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar research databases, according to PRISMA guidelines.

The analysis found that deoxynivalenol was the most prevalent contaminant at 43.8 percent, followed by ochratoxin A at 29.1 percent, enniatin at 23.7 percent, citrinin at 23.6 percent, zearalenone at 17.8 percent, and aflatoxins at 12.4 percent. The majority of studies (84.6 percent) used high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for detection. The review compared contamination rates between two periods (2000–2017 and 2018–2022) and examined whether a country's income level influenced contamination prevalence.  Tea consumption is rising globally, yet the material pathway from leaf to cup carries multiple fungal metabolites whose presence reflects uneven exposure to contamination risk. The prevalence of deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A — compounds produced by field fungi during growth and storage — suggests that tea operates simultaneously as a commodity subject to post-harvest degradation and as a consumed substance whose safety depends on agricultural practices and infrastructure conditions that vary by region and economic capacity. This paper documents not merely a health concern but a material entanglement: the same drying, storage, and transport conditions that preserve tea's market value can also concentrate the metabolic byproducts of moulds, making contamination both a marker of where tea is grown and processed, and a consequence of how it moves through global supply chains.",

    "excerpt": "A 76-year-old man with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was admitted for chemotherapy with curative intent. During treatment he developed febrile neutropenia and a respiratory infection that rapidly progressed to septic shock. Dermatology was consulted for a 3-day purpuric eruption on the left hemithorax and flank, composed of well-demarcated annular targetoid plaques with central induration and purpuric rims (Figure 1a). In the setting of refractory sepsis despite broad-spectrum antimicrobials, the morphology suggested septic emboli or vasculotropic infection. Punch biopsies from the centre and rim were sent for histopathology, culture and molecular testing and escalation to liposomal amphotericin B was recommended. Histology revealed extensive occlusive angioinvasive fungal thrombi (Figure 1b); PCR identified Mucorales, establishing disseminated mucormycosis, likely from a pulmonary source.

A purpuric eruption appeared on the left side of the chest and flank, consisting of well-defined ring-shaped plaques with central hardening and purple borders. Skin biopsies from the centre and edge of the lesions revealed extensive fungal material blocking blood vessels, with molecular testing identifying Mucorales, confirming disseminated mucormycosis originating from the lungs. The patient's critical condition and failure to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics prompted escalation to liposomal amphotericin B treatment. This paper demonstrates that recognition of purpuric ring-shaped skin eruptions in immune-weakened, critically ill patients can signal life-threatening invasive fungal infection.  The appearance of Mucorales in skin lesions during chemotherapy-induced immune suppression reveals a material entanglement between cancer treatment protocols and fungal invasion pathways. The same conditions that destroy cancer cells—neutropenia, barrier disruption, systemic inflammation—create ecological openings for opportunistic moulds to establish vascular invasion and disseminate from respiratory sites to distant tissues. The purpuric targetoid pattern itself becomes a readable trace of this entanglement: a visible record of where fungal thrombi have blocked blood flow and triggered tissue death, transforming the skin into a diagnostic surface that exposes the hidden metabolic vulnerabilities produced by contemporary oncology practice.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Introduction Relapses occur in up to 40% of patients after prolonged courses of antifungal treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). The factors predisposing to relapse remain poorly defined. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of adults treated for ≥ 6 months with oral azoles for CPA. Patients who completed antifungal therapy and were deemed not to require further treatment were included. Demographic, clinical, radiological and serological data at treatment completion were collected. CPA relapse was defined as symptomatic and radiological deterioration leading to re‐initiation of antifungal therapy. Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analyses were used to identify predictors of relapse and mortality. Results Among 125 patients (56% male; mean age 61 years), median treatment duration was 36 months. Thirty‐two (26%) developed relapse; relapse rate at 1 year was 16%. Aspergillus sensitisation (specific IgE &gt; 0.35 IU/mL) and elevated Aspergillus ‐specific IgG (&gt; 40 mg/L) at treatment completion were independently associated with relapse ( p &lt; 0.05). No patient with IgG &lt; 40 mg/L relapsed. Underlying lung disease (COPD or prior tuberculosis), extent of radiological involvement, or treatment duration were not significantly associated with relapse or mortality. Conclusions Aspergillus sensitisation and persistently elevated Aspergillus ‐specific IgG at the end of antifungal therapy were independent predictors of CPA relapse. These parameters may reflect ongoing fungal airway burden and can help identify patients requiring extended or closer post‐treatment follow‐up.

Patients with elevated Aspergillus-specific IgG (above 40 milligrams per litre) at treatment completion had significantly higher relapse rates;  no patient with IgG below this threshold relapsed during follow-up. Aspergillus sensitisation, measured as specific IgE above 0.35 international units per millilitre, was also independently associated with relapse. Among the 125 patients (56 percent male, mean age 61 years) who completed at least six months of oral azole therapy, 32 (26 percent) experienced relapse, with a one-year relapse rate of 16 percent. Median treatment duration was 36 months. Underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or prior tuberculosis, the extent of radiological involvement, or the length of antifungal treatment were not significantly associated with relapse risk.  The persistent elevation of Aspergillus-specific antibodies after prolonged antifungal treatment suggests a duality in what these serological markers represent: they simultaneously indicate successful immune recognition of the fungus and ongoing fungal presence in the airway. Rather than signalling cure, these antibodies may reflect a material persistence—fungal material or metabolic byproducts continuing to circulate or colonise lung tissue despite months of drug exposure. This finding reveals how the same immunological response that protects against acute infection can become a marker of incomplete clearance, positioning certain patients in a state of precarious stability where relapse becomes not a random event but a predictable consequence of incomplete fungal elimination.",

Laboratory tests showed the compound was highly effective against the target fungus and demonstrated activity against other fungal pathogens. Trials in fruit and greenhouse settings confirmed robust control of gray mold, including strains that had already developed resistance to multiple classes of existing fungicides. The researchers used AlphaFold2 protein modeling and molecular docking to show that ipflufenoquin binds to a specific site on the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzyme, with binding strength correlating to fungal susceptibility. Gene expression analysis revealed that the compound suppresses the fungus's basic metabolic processes while triggering stress responses, including increased activity of detoxification and efflux transporter genes that may contribute to resistance mechanisms.  Yet the treatment revealed an ecological cost embedded in the strawberry production system: controlling *Botrytis cinerea* created space for less sensitive fungal genera including *Cladosporium* and *Rhizopus* to proliferate. This pattern—where a targeted fungicide simultaneously eliminates a threat and reshapes the microbial community toward species that escape the same chemical pressure—illustrates how agricultural interventions operate within entangled systems of pathogen, crop, and capital.

Natural products, known for their diverse bioactivities and unique structures, remain critical sources for antifungal drug discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal compounds from soil microbes and isolated a novel 28-membered polyene macrolide, compound 1 , from Kitasatospora melanogena . This compound demonstrated potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 4–16 μg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Treatment with compound 1 led to significant growth reduction and disruption of the cell wall and membrane in A. fumigatus compared to the wild-type. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus exposed to compound 1 , revealing a substantial downregulation of genes involved in cell wall and membrane biogenesis, as well as those encoding integral membrane proteins and multidrug transporters. Additionally, compound 1 induced oxidative stress, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. These multifaceted mechanisms highlight the potential of K. melanogena natural products in the development of novel antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current treatments are limited and increasingly undermined by resistance.

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Chemical fungicides act by targeting specific proteins or pathways, known as modes of action (MoAs). In this study, we established a systematic screening platform using Fusarium graminearum gene knockout mutants to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides and identify novel antifungal compounds. Target genes corresponding to major fungicide classes were deleted by homologous recombination, and the resulting mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to the corresponding fungicides compared with the wild-type strain. Deletion of genes encoding known fungicide targets revealed distinct sensitivity profiles, supporting MoA prediction. Using the platform that detects sensitivity differences through OD ₆₀₀ changes, we examined a chemical library of 2,704 small molecules and identified 8 compounds with activity likely involved in the osmotic signal transduction pathway. Several of these compounds exhibited previously unreported antifungal activity, underscoring their potential as novel scaffolds for future development.

The researchers deleted genes encoding known fungicide targets in the pathogen using homologous recombination, creating mutant strains with altered sensitivity profiles to existing fungicides. These mutants served as a diagnostic tool: screening a library of 2,704 small molecules against both wild-type and mutant strains revealed compounds that affected fungal growth through specific pathways. The study identified 8 compounds with activity linked to the osmotic signal transduction pathway—the cellular mechanism that allows fungi to sense and respond to water stress—several of which showed antifungal properties not previously documented. The platform detects active compounds by measuring changes in optical density at 600 nanometers, a standard measure of cell density and growth.  The dual logic of this approach—using genetic vulnerability to map chemical action—exposes a material tension in fungicide development. The same genetic deletions that make mutants sensitive to novel compounds also reveal why resistance emerges: fungi can survive by altering or abandoning specific pathways, a capacity that fungicides themselves select for under repeated application. The 8 newly identified compounds targeting osmotic signalling represent not a solution to resistance but a temporary advantage in an ongoing arms race shaped by agricultural intensification and monoculture. What this paper documents is not the discovery of a durable antifungal but rather the systematic production of knowledge about fungal vulnerability—knowledge that, once deployed in fields, will itself accelerate the evolution of tolerance in populations already stressed by the chemical and economic pressures of industrial grain production.",

Strong evidence shows that exposure of fish to mycotoxins can negatively affect their health, leading to reduced growth, impaired immune response and reproductive disorders. However, knowledge of the effects of mycotoxins on farmed insects is still limited. Little is known about the insect metabolism of mycotoxins and their transfer to animal feed, which constitutes a weakness of safety assessments of insects as feed components.

However, the metabolism of mold toxins in farmed insects remains poorly understood, and data on how insects process and transfer these toxins to feed are sparse—a critical gap in evaluating insect-based feed safety. This review compiles measured mold toxin levels across plant materials, finished aquaculture feeds, and fish-derived food sources, summarizes documented effects of specific mold toxins on fish health, and identifies unresolved safety questions around insects as a protein ingredient.  The expansion of insect farming as a sustainable feed source reveals a material entanglement: the same shift toward \"modern\" ingredients designed to reduce pressure on wild fish stocks and plant agriculture simultaneously introduces a biological pathway—insect metabolism—that remains largely opaque to safety assessment. Mold toxins move through feed chains in ways that depend on the specific organism processing them; what an insect does with a toxin differs from what a plant does, yet this difference is unmeasured and unaccounted for in current safety frameworks.

Deletion of chsb1 produced measurable defects: reduced colony expansion, loss of upright filament formation, thinner protective cell walls, and widespread reorganization of wall composition. Disruption of chsb2 or chsb3 individually caused only minor effects, but deleting both genes simultaneously triggered severe impairment—complete absence of upright filaments, abnormal cell division patterns, and substantial growth failure. Both deletion strains accumulated higher absolute amounts of chitin despite their structural and developmental problems.  The findings reveal how a single structural polymer—chitin—can be simultaneously overproduced and functionally compromised depending on which enzyme variants are absent. In Pleurotus, the loss of specific chitin synthase genes triggers compensatory chitin accumulation that fails to restore normal cell wall architecture or growth capacity, suggesting that quantity of material and quality of assembly are decoupled processes. This material entanglement—where a fungus produces more of a critical polymer yet becomes more fragile and developmentally arrested—mirrors broader patterns in the Patchy Anthropocene where organisms and their products become simultaneously more abundant and less functional under stress, revealing how metabolic responses to disruption can paradoxically intensify vulnerability rather than resolve it.",

    "excerpt": "Candida albicans uniquely possesses an expanded family of genes (the TLO gene family) that encodes 10&#8211;15 paralogues of the Med2 component of the transcriptional regulator Mediator. Previous studies have shown that TLO null mutants are unable to form hyphae and are hypersensitive to environmental stress. However, the reason for the TLO gene expansion remains unclear, and the current study aimed to determine if reduction in the TLO family copy number affected virulence. In order to investigate this, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to generate two TLO-depleted mutants: one mutant retaining only TLO&#946;2 (CaTLO2) and the second mutant containing only TLO&#947;5 (CaTLO5). Both TLO-depleted mutants exhibited increased filamentous growth, increased susceptibility to specific stresses and reduced virulence in a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). In vitro, the CaTLO5 mutant also exhibited impaired hyphal escape from macrophages and reduced hyphal invasion of oral keratinocytes.

    "summary": "Candida albicans possesses an unusually large family of TLO genes—10 to 15 copies—that produce variants of the Med2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Mediator. Previous work showed that complete loss of all TLO genes prevents the organism from forming hyphae (elongated filamentous structures) and increases sensitivity to environmental stress, but the evolutionary advantage of maintaining multiple copies remained unexplained. This study used genetic editing to create two mutants: one retaining only the TLOβ2 gene variant and another retaining only the TLOγ5 variant. Both depleted mutants showed increased filamentous growth in culture, heightened vulnerability to specific stresses, and reduced ability to cause infection in mice with oropharyngeal candidiasis (a fungal infection of the mouth and throat). In cell-based assays, the TLOγ5 mutant specifically showed impaired capacity to escape from immune cells called macrophages and reduced ability to invade oral skin cells. The researchers then tested whether adding back the TLOα1 gene variant—previously shown to restore normal growth in completely TLO-depleted strains—could restore disease-causing ability, though the abstract does not report the outcome of this complementation experiment.  The TLO gene expansion in Candida albicans appears to encode functional redundancy tied directly to pathogenic capacity: the same genetic duplication that allows the organism to maintain disease-causing ability under stress also constrains its ability to survive immune pressure and invade host tissues when copy number drops. The tension emerges not between pathogen and resource, but between genetic robustness and clinical vulnerability—a pattern shaped by the selective pressures of human mucosal colonization and the specific immunological barriers of oral epithelium.",

    "summary": "The filamentous bacterium Actinoplanes missouriensis produces terminal sporangia—spherical structures containing hundreds of spores held together by a matrix and outer envelope. This paper identifies a protein called SspA, displayed on the spore surface and anchored to the cell wall through a sortase-dependent mechanism, as essential for sporangium structural integrity. The mature form of SspA is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein, a type lacking fixed three-dimensional shape. When the gene encoding SspA was deleted, sporangia still formed but became mechanically fragile, collapsing immediately when exposed to aqueous solutions and releasing spores prematurely. Transmission electron microscopy showed that sporangia lacking SspA failed to mature properly: the electron-dense matrix material that normally surrounds individual spores in the peripheral region was absent, and the outer envelope of some sporangia was visibly damaged. Peptide-tagged versions of SspA produced in the mutant strain were detected on zoospore surfaces using the HiBiT detection system.  The structural failure of sporangia without SspA reveals a material dependency embedded in the life cycle of this bacterium. A single protein—disordered in structure yet precisely positioned on the spore surface—appears to mediate the cohesion between individual spores and the matrix that contains them, a function that becomes visible only through its absence. This arrangement exemplifies how microbial survival strategies depend on specific material assemblages: the sporangium envelope, matrix, and surface proteins form an integrated system where weakness in one component cascades into collective fragility, suggesting that the robustness of these bacterial structures emerges not from rigid architectural design but from distributed material interactions that can fail catastrophically when disrupted.",

    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Aspergillus infection poses a major clinical challenge, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with invasive diseases associated with high mortality. While Aspergillus fumigatus remains the predominant species causing human infections, recent studies highlight the growing clinical significance of lesser-known and cryptic Aspergillus species, which often exhibit reduced susceptibility to standard antifungal therapies. In this study, we analyzed 196 clinical Aspergillus isolates from 107 patients treated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2019 and 2022. A total of 38 Aspergillus species across 11 taxonomic sections were identified, with non- fumigatus and cryptic species accounting for 77.1% of all isolates. The most frequently recovered species were A. fumigatus sensu stricto (22.9%), A. sydowii (8.7%), A. calidoustus (7.1%), A. nidulans (6.6%), A. tanneri (6.1%), and A. terreus (5.6%). Species-level identification was achieved in 43% of isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In contrast, PCR sequencing confirmed species identity in over 88% of isolates by targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, 81% using the β-tubulin gene, and 68% using the calmodulin gene. The most common underlying clinical conditions among patients were bronchiectasis (35%), chronic granulomatous disease (22%), and pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (17%). Out of 107 patients, eight died (8/107, 7.5%); six of these deaths occurred in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and two in patients with RAG1 deficiency. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that olorofim had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations across species.

This study examines phosphorene, a two-dimensional nanomaterial with a tunable bandgap, high surface-to-volume ratio, and high electron mobility, as the basis for faster and cheaper detection systems.

The dual character of this technological development reflects broader patterns in food safety infrastructure under resource constraint. Phosphorene nanosensors promise to democratize mycotoxin detection—moving it from expensive laboratory facilities to on-site, low-cost monitoring—yet this same shift relocates detection capacity away from centralized oversight toward distributed, decentralized points in food supply chains. The material properties that make phosphorene effective (its sensitivity, its capacity to integrate with multiple sensor types) are the same properties that render it dependent on continued synthesis, functionalization, and maintenance; the promise of accessible detection thus entangles food producers and retailers in new technical dependencies and supply relationships.",

Researchers isolated 35 mold colonies total, with *Aspergillus flavus* comprising 46 percent of isolates, followed by *Aspergillus niger* and *Aspergillus candidus* at 11.43 percent each. Of the 16 *Aspergillus flavus* strains recovered, half carried all five genes required for aflatoxin production, yet only four strains demonstrated actual aflatoxin-producing capacity when tested by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, with aflatoxin B1 levels ranging from 0.52 to 1030 micrograms per liter. Ochratoxin A appeared in all nine feed samples at a mean concentration of 33.6 micrograms per kilogram, while Fumonisin B1 was detected in 97 percent of samples at 247.1 micrograms per kilogram; only one sample contained Aflatoxin B1 at 5.84 micrograms per kilogram, a substance classified as carcinogenic to humans.  The presence of these toxigenic fungi and their metabolites in feed materials reveals a material pathway through which occupational hazard enters the farm workplace. The genetic capacity for toxin production does not guarantee actual toxin release—a gap illustrated by the discrepancy between strains carrying biosynthetic genes and those demonstrating measurable aflatoxin output—yet the feeds themselves remain contaminated with multiple mycotoxins regardless of their origin, creating a tangible exposure risk for workers handling these materials daily. Feed contamination thus operates simultaneously as an indicator of agricultural vulnerability to fungal colonization and as a mechanism through which workers become exposed to carcinogenic substances embedded in the routine materials of intensive animal production.",

Within Punjab's dairy sector, contamination emerges not as a uniform biological threat but as a stratified exposure shaped by material storage practices and educational access. The concentration of aflatoxins in the central region—tied to on-farm grain storage—reveals how economic constraints and agricultural infrastructure determine which populations encounter higher mycotoxin loads in their feed and milk. Education functions here as both a marker of awareness and a proxy for economic position: farmers with greater schooling possess resources to adopt safer storage methods and market engagement, while those dependent on self-stored grains face both the biological hazard and the structural conditions that produce it. The efficacy of training interventions suggests that contamination is not inevitable but rather contingent on knowledge and material capacity—a pattern that implicates broader patterns of rural inequality in how mycotoxin exposure is distributed across the region.",

    "summary": "This paper identifies critical gaps in the standardization and interpretation of human biomonitoring data for mycotoxins—fungal poisons that accumulate in food systems and enter human bodies through consumption. The study documents major technical obstacles: sampling inconsistencies (whether urine is collected as a single spot sample or over 24 hours; whether blood plasma or serum is used), analytical problems (absence of reference standards for comparison, interference from sample matrix components, difficulty measuring protein-bound mycotoxin forms, variable recovery rates, detection limits too high to catch low exposures, and degradation during storage), and fundamental knowledge gaps about how mycotoxins move through human bodies and how much exposure causes harm. This paper reviews recent biomonitoring studies and outlines what future research must address to produce reliable exposure data suitable for health risk assessment.  The tension documented here reflects a deeper entanglement: mycotoxins are simultaneously ubiquitous food contaminants and poorly characterized human exposures. The machinery for detecting them in human tissues exists but remains fragmented across incompatible methods and unstandardized protocols—a fragmentation that mirrors the patchy geography of mycotoxin contamination itself, where exposure varies sharply by food supply, storage conditions, and access to tested products. Without harmonized biomonitoring frameworks and basic toxicokinetic data, the capacity to document and quantify human harm remains unequally distributed, leaving populations dependent on contaminated food systems unable to establish baseline exposure or track whether interventions work.",

    "summary": "This review examines probiotics as biological preservatives that work against mycotoxins—toxic compounds produced by moulds—in food systems. The paper describes two mechanisms of action: probiotics can inhibit mycotoxin production directly and can also neutralize mycotoxins after they form, thereby preventing their carcinogenic effects when contaminated food is consumed. The review synthesizes experimental case studies demonstrating probiotics' capacity to function both as preventive agents at the food production stage and as mitigating agents within the human body after ingestion. The authors position probiotics as alternatives to synthetic chemical detoxifiers, though they acknowledge significant limitations: strain-specific effectiveness varies widely, clinical evidence in human populations remains sparse, and environmental conditions substantially affect whether probiotics perform as intended.  Within the material entanglements of industrial food production, probiotics emerge as both a solution and a symptom of deeper dependencies. These living organisms are enlisted to manage contamination caused by other living organisms—moulds that thrive in the same conditions of storage, transport, and economic pressure that make food systems vulnerable. The dual function attributed to probiotics here—preventing mould-derived toxins while also remediating their effects in human bodies—reveals how biological management strategies can obscure rather than resolve the structural conditions that enable mycotoxin contamination in the first place. What appears as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical intervention is simultaneously a technology that allows food systems organized around speed, storage, and profit to persist without fundamental restructuring.",

    "summary": "Fusarium head blight is a significant constraint on wheat production in Uruguay. This paper used liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to measure five mycotoxins—zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and nivalenol—in 71 commercial wheat samples collected from the 2018 harvest across multiple cultivars and regions. Mycotoxins were detected in 47 samples, with deoxynivalenol present in 46 of these, ranging from 102 to 10,507 micrograms per kilogram. Nivalenol appeared in 8 samples at levels between 37 and 66 micrograms per kilogram, zearalenone in 6 samples between 104 and 5,193 micrograms per kilogram, and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol in one sample at 67 micrograms per kilogram; 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol was not detected. Cultivars bred for susceptibility to head blight showed higher rates of contamination and elevated concentrations of deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, though cultivars with moderate resistance did not consistently show lower deoxynivalenol levels across all samples tested.  The contamination patterns documented in this paper reveal how crop genetics and fungal toxin accumulation are entangled within commercial wheat supply chains. The persistent presence of deoxynivalenol across nearly all contaminated samples, alongside the variable appearance of secondary toxins, suggests that Fusarium populations in Uruguayan wheat fields are metabolically flexible—capable of producing multiple toxic compounds under different field conditions, yet reliably producing one dominant toxin regardless of cultivar choice. This pattern reflects not merely a biological fact but a material condition of contemporary grain production: the toxins that mark certain wheat batches as unmarketable in regulated economies can simultaneously serve as indicators of which cultivars and growing regions require intervention, creating new sites where agricultural management, trade standards, and fungal metabolism converge.",

    "excerpt": "This study aimed to optimize a solid-state fermentation approach to produce valuable substances from two grape pomace (GP) varieties fermented with two Aspergillus strains (A. oryzae and A. tamarii) with aqueous extract samples collected over 6 days. The aqueous extracts were characterized by °Brix, pH, titratable acidity, total phenolics, 4 individual sugars, 5 organic acids, and 4 phenolics. The results showed °Brix, pH, and titratable acidity changed monotonically with fermentation, corresponding to changes in individual sugars and organic acids. Fermentation nearly depleted fructose (98–99%), glucose (>99%), and tartaric acid (62–99%), lowering °Brix and titratable acidity while raising pH. Fermentation also significantly increased gallic acid (124–159%) and produced kojic acid (0.041 g/g pomace dry mass). Phenolic extraction was maximized with 1–3 days of fermentations. The PCA biplot showed that fermentation duration and GP variety were the primary drivers of variation in chemical composition, while strain type had minimal impact. The increased phenolic extraction and novel production of kojic acid demonstrated GP’s potential as a source of valuable microbial metabolites.",

Phenolic extraction peaked between days one and three of fermentation.  Within the material entanglement of wine production and fungal metabolism, this paper documents how a byproduct of industrial viticulture—grape pomace—becomes a site where fungal growth simultaneously extracts existing phenolic compounds and generates novel metabolites like kojic acid. The same Aspergillus species that signal spoilage or contamination in other contexts here function as metabolic factories, converting agricultural waste into compounds with potential pharmaceutical or cosmetic value. This dual capacity reveals how the valuation of fungal activity depends entirely on location and intention: the same fermentation process that would constitute spoilage in a wine cellar becomes productive accumulation in a fermentation vessel, turning material exclusion into economic resource.",

We analyzed 161 clinical isolates across four common mold genera: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. (with A. flavus and A. fumigatus ), Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp. Daily images were captured from the top and bottom of culture plates over 5 days using a standardized smartphone setup, generating over 4,000 images. We trained three variations of Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmarked the best-performing model (VGG16 with dual classification heads) against LightGBM models trained on pre-extracted features and human expert assessments at various time points. The best-performing VGG16 model achieved a mean (SD) AUROC of 92.7% ± 1.8% and sensitivity of 68.7% ± 2.6% across all species. Here, the performance in identifying Cladosporium spp. was best (AUROC of 99.9% ± 0.1%, fivefold cross-validation mean and SD). Regarding the evaluations over time, early-stage classification (days 1–2) was challenging (F1-score 38.8% ± 3.5% across all species) but improved significantly on days 3–5 (F1 92.1% ± 2.8% across all species). Compared to experts, MoldVision consistently showed superior performance, particularly in mature cultures, detecting subtle morphological features earlier and more accurately.

    "title": "GSNOR is essential for nitric oxide homeostasis and involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus",
    "source": "American Society for Microbiology: Applied and Environmental Microbiology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) is an important biological signaling molecule. S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a master regulator of NO signaling, regulates various biological processes. However, little is known about the role of GSNOR in Aspergillus flavus . Here, we identified a gene encoding GSNOR in this aflatoxigenic fungus and demonstrated that GSNOR shows activity during the critical life cycle stages, including spore germination, hyphal growth, and conidiogenesis. We found that GSNOR plays a crucial role in NO homeostasis, as GSNOR deletion resulted in significantly elevated NO levels and heightened sensitivity to exogenous NO stress. GSNOR also participated in multiple biological processes in A. flavus ; for that, GSNOR deletion impaired conidia germination, reduced growth, decreased conidiogenesis and sclerotial development, attenuated virulence on kernels, and notably decreased aflatoxin production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSNOR is important for reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, as its deletion significantly elevated mycelial ROS levels and made the strain more sensitive to oxidative stress. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus flavus is a notorious saprophytic filamentous fungus, with its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins posing serious threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxin contamination prevention and control have long been a global challenge. In previous studies, we observed that nitric oxide (NO) significantly inhibits the aflatoxin production by A. flavus . This study further investigated the role of the key regulatory enzyme S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in the NO signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GSNOR is crucial for maintaining both NO homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and plays an essential role in fungal development, pathogenicity, and aflatoxin biosynthesis. These results highlight the potential of targeting components in the NO signaling pathway, such as GSNOR, as a novel strategy",

    "summary": "Nitric oxide homeostasis in Aspergillus flavus is regulated by the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which this paper identifies as essential for controlling nitrogen oxide signaling in the fungus. When S-nitrosoglutathione reductase was deleted, nitric oxide accumulated to elevated levels and the fungus became hypersensitive to external nitric oxide stress. The deletion also disrupted the fungus's ability to manage reactive oxygen species, causing accumulation of these damaging molecules and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress. Across multiple developmental stages—spore germination, hyphal growth, and spore formation—S-nitrosoglutathione reductase deletion impaired fungal development, reduced growth rate, weakened the ability to form protective sclerotial structures, and notably decreased production of aflatoxin, the carcinogenic compound that makes Aspergillus flavus a major food safety hazard. The fungus also showed reduced capacity to infect crop kernels when S-nitrosoglutathione reductase was absent.  The dual role of nitric oxide emerges here as both constraint and opportunity: the same signaling pathway that the fungus requires for normal development and toxin production is simultaneously a point of vulnerability that could be exploited for control. This paper suggests that blocking components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway—specifically S-nitrosoglutathione reductase—could suppress aflatoxin biosynthesis without necessarily killing the organism outright, positioning chemical interference with fungal signaling as a potential food safety intervention. Yet this approach also reveals a deeper entanglement: controlling a pathogenic fungus through its own regulatory machinery means targeting the same molecular systems that govern its basic survival and reproduction, raising questions about whether such interventions remain stable or whether selective pressure might generate fungal variants that circumvent this constraint.",

These findings expose a material entanglement between pet food production and fungal metabolite accumulation in supply chains serving herbivorous animals with limited regulatory oversight. The selective vulnerability of rabbits and rodents—whose gut microbiota can be disrupted by these toxins—reveals how emerging mycotoxins operate simultaneously as unmonitored contaminants and as agents that reshape the internal ecology of captive herbivores, creating new dependencies on feed quality assurance systems that currently do not exist.

    "summary": "This paper describes the development of a high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to detect fungal toxins across chicken tissues and eggs. The study optimized analysis of 38 fungal toxins, with quantification of 30 in chicken serum, 29 in egg yolk, and 29 in egg white. Sample preparation used solvent extraction followed by removal of proteins and phospholipids; the method processed 96 samples in four hours. Chromatographic separation employed an Acquity Premier BEH C18 column with water and methanol as mobile phases under gradient conditions, while the mass spectrometer used electrospray ionization with polarity switching and monitored multiple reaction transitions. Validation followed European guidelines with detection thresholds set at 200 nanograms per millilitre for serum and 20 micrograms per kilogram for egg tissues.  The method's capacity to track fungal toxins across animal tissues and food products reveals the material pathways through which contamination from feed enters human food chains. That the same analytical infrastructure can simultaneously quantify both regulated and emerging toxins suggests how the detection of fungal contamination depends on the prior identification of risk — a classification that shifts with regulatory attention and market pressure rather than with the toxins themselves. The optimization of high-throughput processing reflects the scale at which such contamination must now be monitored to maintain food safety, embedding fungal toxin analysis into routine industrial surveillance of animal agriculture.",

    "excerpt": "<i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (<i>A. flavus</i>) is a plant pathogenic fungus that produces toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxins, posing a threat to food safety and human health. As a kind of food additive, phytic acid (PA) exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity. However, the antifungal effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> are not well understood. Here, transcriptomic and biochemical analyses were carried out to investigate the inhibitory effects of PA against <i>A. flavus</i> and potential mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that PA effectively inhibited the vegetative growth, conidiation and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production of <i>A. flavus</i>. In addition, we found that PA also suppressed the pathogenicity of <i>A. flavus</i> on peanut and maize seeds. The transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, oxidative stress, ergosterol biosynthesis, and the MAPK signalling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i>. Biochemical experiments further demonstrated that PA could destroy cell membrane integrity and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, eventually resulting in defects of development and AFB1 biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>. Taken together, this research enhances understanding of the antifungal mechanism of PA, and provides novel insights into its potential as a food additive to prevent and control <i>A. flavus</i> contamination.",

Gene expression analysis revealed that phytic acid altered the activity of genes involved in fungal development, toxin biosynthesis, stress response, cell membrane synthesis, and cellular signalling pathways. Biochemical experiments showed that phytic acid damaged the fungal cell membrane and triggered accumulation of reactive oxygen species—unstable oxygen-containing molecules that cause cellular damage—ultimately disrupting both fungal growth and toxin production. The compound also reduced the ability of *Aspergillus flavus* to infect peanut and maize seeds.  Within food storage systems, this research documents a material intervention—phytic acid—that simultaneously acts as a preservative and a stressor. The fungus experiences phytic acid not as a simple poison but as a metabolic disruptor that forces cellular damage and blocks the biosynthetic pathways through which it produces aflatoxins. The same compound that protects stored grain from fungal contamination operates by destabilizing the membrane boundaries and oxidative balance that permit fungal survival, revealing how food safety depends on manipulating the material conditions under which pathogens persist or fail.",

    "excerpt": "Contamination of food products such as rice with mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins (AFs), can endanger human health and cause economic problems. Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a public health concern, especially in countries where rice is a staple food, due to its carcinogenic, acute, and chronic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentration levels of AFB1 in domestic (Iranian) rice samples. The presence and mean concentration of AFB1 in 70 Iranian rice samples collected from local markets in Tehran, Iran were measured using a competitive ELISA method. Furthermore, a health risk assessment was performed based on estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFB1 from rice consumption, margin of exposure (MOE), and liver cancer risk in Iranian children and adults. AFB1 was detected in 26 samples (37.1%) with the mean concentration levels of 1.86 ± 0.67 ng/g (ranges from 1.12 to 4.26); of these, 7 samples (26.9%) had values exceeding the limit set by European Union regulations (2 ng/g). Additionally, AFB1 contamination in no rice sample exceeded the maximum limit accepted by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation (5 ng/g). This study showed that the mean EDI of AFB1 was 9 and 3 ng/kg bw/day for children and adults, respectively. In addition, the mean MOEs for children and adults were 18 and 64, respectively, indicating a public health concern. In addition, the present study showed that the risks of liver cancer associated with rice consumption among Iranian children and adults were 0.13 and 0.04 cancer cases/year/per 10<sup>5</sup> people, respectively. This study showed that monitoring AFB1 levels in rice is essential for assessing food safety and protecting public health, particularly in developing countries where rice is a staple food.",

Seven samples exceeded European Union regulatory limits of 2 nanograms per gram, though all samples remained below the 5 nanogram per gram threshold set by Iranian National Standardisation Organisation. This paper measured aflatoxin B1 using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and calculated daily intake exposure based on rice consumption patterns, finding mean daily intakes of 9 nanograms per kilogram of body weight for children and 3 nanograms per kilogram of body weight for adults. The margin of exposure—a ratio comparing safe exposure levels to actual intake—was 18 for children and 64 for adults, both indicating potential public health concern. Estimated liver cancer risk from rice consumption was 0.13 cases per year per 100,000 people in children and 0.04 cases per year per 100,000 people in adults.  This paper documents a material entanglement characteristic of food systems in developing economies: the same grain that provides nutritional security simultaneously carries a carcinogenic contaminant whose presence reflects prior exposures during cultivation, storage, and distribution. The regulatory gap between European Union limits and Iranian standards—a twofold difference—reveals how acceptable risk thresholds are negotiated through economic and political channels rather than biological necessity, leaving populations consuming rice as a dietary staple subject to differential protection depending on where safety standards are set. Children's higher estimated daily intake and lower margin of exposure expose the uneven distribution of hazard within households, where dietary staples concentrate exposure among those least able to avoid them.",

The samples included three types of tea (green, oolong, and black) and ten types of spices (black pepper, white pepper, cardamom, coriander seed, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder, nutmeg, star anise, and turmeric powder). Using a rapid extraction method followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, the researchers detected various mycotoxins across the samples at differing levels. All black pepper and cinnamon samples tested positive for mycotoxin contamination, while black tea samples showed no detectable contamination. Beauvericin, an emerging mycotoxin, was identified among the contaminants, though the abstract ends before reporting complete findings.  The selective contamination pattern across these commodities—universal in some spices, absent in others—reflects the material conditions of their production and trade rather than uniform exposure. Black pepper and cinnamon's consistent contamination suggests particular vulnerabilities in cultivation, drying, or storage that create conditions favourable to mould growth, while the absence of mycotoxins in black tea indicates that processing or sourcing practices can interrupt this pathway. These Bangkok market samples thus document how the same fungal metabolites operate simultaneously as health hazards for consumers and as indicators of labour conditions, agricultural stress, and post-harvest infrastructure—revealing how food safety emerges not as a universal standard but as a patchy outcome of specific material arrangements across supply chains.",

    "summary": "Pastures and conserved forages across 21 farms in the Southeast region of Brazil contained detectable mycotoxins in 94% and 91% of samples respectively, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Aflatoxins and ochratoxin A dominated pasture contamination, while fumonisins and zearalenone were most prevalent in hay, haylage, and silage. The grass species Urochloa spp. accumulated the highest mycotoxin loads, particularly T-2 toxin, aflatoxins, and ochratoxin A. Seasonal variation was evident: ochratoxin A peaked in summer pastures while fumonisins were more common in winter. Mean aflatoxin levels in both pastures and conserved forages exceeded European Union maximum tolerance limits for animal feed. Multiple mycotoxins co-occurred in 70% of pasture samples and 34% of conserved forage samples, with aflatoxins combined with fumonisins, T-2 toxin, or ochratoxin A forming the most common contamination patterns.  The mycotoxin burden documented in this paper reveals how fungal metabolites become embedded in the material infrastructure of livestock production—pasture grasses and stored feed—across a region. Rather than appearing as discrete contaminants, these toxins accumulate as overlapping chemical assemblages shaped by seasonal moisture and storage conditions, creating simultaneous exposure pathways for grazing and confined animals. The detection of aflatoxins at levels exceeding regulatory thresholds across both fresh and processed forages indicates that contamination persists through preservation methods, suggesting that the economic pressures driving intensified forage production and storage in Brazilian agriculture may systematically distribute fungal toxins through feed chains in ways that current regulatory frameworks do not fully contain.",

This paper tested whether dietary supplements containing chromium bound to the amino acid methionine (Cr-Met) and selenium bound to methionine (Se-Met)—given separately or together alongside aflatoxin-contaminated feed at 2 milligrams of aflatoxins per kilogram—could reverse these effects. Mice receiving either Cr-Met or Se-Met showed marked recovery in growth rate, feed consumption, and immune markers (immunoglobulin levels), while oxidative stress indicators and liver damage decreased. Gene expression patterns revealed that aflatoxin exposure triggered overproduction of an inflammatory enzyme (inducible nitric oxide synthase) while suppressing a protective antioxidant enzyme (catalase); supplementation partially reversed these patterns.  Within contaminated food systems, the same mycotoxins that damage animal bodies and reduce agricultural productivity become sites where mineral supplements—themselves products of industrial extraction and processing—acquire economic and biological value as remediation inputs. The protective capacity of these organic mineral compounds does not eliminate the underlying dependency on contaminated feed chains; rather, it reveals how damage mitigation becomes a new market segment within systems that continue to generate the original harm. The mice's recovery through supplementation demonstrates a material entanglement where industrial agriculture's failure to prevent fungal contamination is offset by the addition of further industrial inputs, each layer of intervention reflecting deeper structural vulnerabilities in feed production and storage.",

Within the turbulent ecology of marine fungal assemblages, this paper documents how a single organism produces metabolites that operate simultaneously as antimicrobial agents and as chemical tools for understanding fungal vulnerability. The compounds' capacity to work additively with established pharmaceuticals reveals not a simple antimicrobial property but a material entanglement: the same molecules that might serve as leads for drug development also expose the dependencies of clinical treatment regimes on combinations of agents, each targeting different cellular systems. The shift from single-compound screening to combined-effect drug pairing reflects how novel fungal metabolites become legible as resources only through their capacity to enhance existing pharmaceutical infrastructure — a pattern that mirrors broader dependencies within biomedical economies on the continuous discovery of natural products to sustain therapeutic efficacy.",

However, its validity as a natural and practical framework has been increasingly questioned. In this study, we critically re-evaluate the forma specialis concept through an extensive survey of Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts from 23 provinces of China. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, morphological assessments, and pathogenicity tests on 659 strains isolated from 171 diseased samples, we identified 46 <i>Fusarium</i> species, including seven newly described taxa, and uncovered extensive cross-host pathogenicity, with up to 21 species associated with the same wilt disease. In addition, 57% of samples exhibited multiple species co-infections, revealing significant inconsistencies with the forma specialis framework. These findings challenge the long-standing paradigm of host specificity in <i>Fusarium</i> pathogens and advocate for a shift of perspective to a \"pathobiome\" framework, where disease dynamics are largely driven by community-level interactions rather than single-pathogen relationships.

The researchers surveyed Fusarium wilt diseases across 37 crop hosts in 23 Chinese provinces, analyzing 659 strains from 171 diseased samples using genetic sequencing, morphological examination, and pathogenicity testing. They identified 46 Fusarium species, including seven previously unknown to science, and found that up to 21 different species could cause the same wilt disease on a single host. Critically, 57% of diseased samples contained multiple Fusarium species simultaneously, revealing that the assumption of one pathogen per disease—central to the forma specialis system—does not reflect what occurs in actual crop fields.  The paper proposes abandoning the single-pathogen model in favour of viewing Fusarium wilt as a \"pathobiome,\" where disease emerges from the collective activity of multiple fungal species rather than from host-specific relationships. This shift exposes a tension between the orderly taxonomic categories that have structured disease management for decades and the material reality of crop fields where multiple pathogenic species coexist, co-infect, and collectively drive disease dynamics. The discovery that the same fungal species can colonize unrelated crops, and that diseased plants routinely harbour multiple species, suggests that sustainable management cannot rely on identifying and controlling single pathogens—instead, it must account for the ecological assemblages that actually inhabit diseased plants.",

Mutant strains, including the knockout (∆pdc1), pdc1 point mutants (K258R and K258E) and complementary (∆pdc1.com) were constructed. The results showed that both Δpdc1 and K258R strains exhibited decreased conidiophore and conidia production and failed to generate sclerotia. The production of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was significantly increased in the Δpdc1 and K258R strains, while it decreased in the K258E strain. The results also indicate that pdc1 and its Ksucc are involved in the stress response and pathogenicity of A. flavus.

    "summary": "This study examined how pyruvate decarboxylase (a metabolic enzyme) and a chemical modification to this enzyme called lysine succinylation shape the development and toxin production of Aspergillus flavus, a fungus that contaminates crops. Researchers created fungal strains with the pyruvate decarboxylase gene deleted or modified at specific sites and compared their growth and chemical output to normal strains. Strains lacking the enzyme or carrying a particular amino acid substitution produced fewer spore-bearing structures and no survival sclerotia, yet paradoxically generated more aflatoxin B1—the carcinogenic toxin this fungus produces. Analysis of the chemical profiles showed that these mutant strains accumulated higher levels of pyruvic acid, malic acid, and succinic acid, while losing production of various fatty acids and volatile compounds detected in normal strains. Gene expression profiling identified nearly 3,800 genes with altered activity in the enzyme-deleted strain, with roughly equal numbers of genes turned up and down.  The findings expose a material entanglement within fungal metabolism: the same enzyme modification that blocks reproductive structures and metabolite diversity simultaneously amplifies toxin accumulation. This reveals how disruption to a single metabolic node can redistribute fungal resources—suppressing investment in spore production and structural compounds while channelling carbon toward aflatoxin biosynthesis. The pattern suggests that under the metabolic stress imposed by enzyme loss, the fungus shifts toward toxin production as an alternative output, a reallocation of biochemical capacity that could reshape both the fungus's ecological role and its hazard profile in agricultural systems where such mutations might arise.",

    "title": "Functionally redundant Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA regulate aflatoxin synthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus by controlling morphogenesis, oxidative balance and energy metabolism",
    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RacA exhibit significant sequence homology and are conserved across eukaryotic species. These proteins function as molecular switches within various signal transduction pathways by cycling between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. However, their specific functions in Aspergillus flavus remain largely unexplored. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizing 5S rRNA and tRNA-gRNA tandem arrays was developed, achieving over 95% single-gene and 75% double-gene editing efficiencies. Phenotypic and transcriptome analyses revealed significant functional redundancy between cdc42 and racA. In the mutants, conidia germination was markedly accelerated, with early germination driven by increased hydrolase activity and ATP levels. The loss of either cdc42 or racA resulted in reduced pathogenicity, compromised cell wall integrity, diminished aflatoxin production, and disrupted oxidative systems. These proteins regulate the generation of ROS through their interaction with NoxR, the regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase (Nox). Cdc42 and RacA exhibited opposing roles in fatty acid β-oxidation and pyruvate metabolism. The simultaneous loss of function in both genes is lethal, as evidenced by the inability of the ∆cdc42racAtetOn mutant to grow on plates lacking doxycycline. The study reveals the critical roles of the closely related genes cdc42 and racA in the growth, development, and metabolism of A. flavus. These findings identify potential targets for mitigating the harmful effects of A. flavus and aflatoxins.",

    "summary": "Cdc42 and RacA are molecular switch proteins that cycle between active and inactive states to regulate cellular signaling across eukaryotic species, yet their specific roles in the aflatoxin-producing fungus Aspergillus flavus had not been characterized. This paper employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with over 95% efficiency for single-gene deletions and 75% for double-gene deletions to examine these proteins. The mutant strains showed accelerated spore germination driven by increased enzyme activity and energy production, while loss of either protein alone reduced the fungus's ability to cause infection, weakened cell wall structure, diminished aflatoxin output, and disrupted the fungus's oxidative defense systems. Both proteins regulate reactive oxygen species generation through interaction with the regulatory component of a key oxidative enzyme complex, and they play opposing roles in fatty acid breakdown and energy production pathways. Deletion of both genes simultaneously proved lethal, indicating functional overlap but also distinct essential contributions to survival.  The findings expose a material entanglement between fungal disease-causing ability and metabolic capacity: the same proteins that enable the fungus to produce aflatoxin—a carcinogenic secondary metabolite of agricultural and public health concern—also govern the cellular processes that sustain growth and energy production under stress. The dual lethality and metabolic antagonism documented here reveal that aflatoxin synthesis is not separable from the fungus's fundamental metabolism, but rather embedded within it. This suggests that targeting these regulatory proteins could disrupt both the fungus's pathogenic capacity and its survival, though any intervention strategy must contend with the fact that these proteins operate at the intersection of multiple essential cellular systems.",

    "excerpt": "Three new racemic bianthrones, including two pairs of (±)-penithrones A (1) and B (2), and a chlorinated derivative (±)-penithrone C (3), along with their biogenetic precursors (4–6) were discovered from the culture extract of the mangrove-derived fungus Penicillium hispanicum LA032 using HSQC-based DeepSAT. The structural elucidation of these new compounds was achieved through comprehensive integration of NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRESIMS), and NMR calculations with CP3 analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against HeLa, HCT116, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 5.09 ± 0.65 to 9.47 ± 0.22 μmol/L. In addition, network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking studies revealed Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10 (MAPK10) as a potential target of 1 for its anticancer effect.",

    "summary": "Penicillium hispanicum, a fungus isolated from mangrove environments, produced three previously unknown bianthrone compounds when cultured in the laboratory. Two of these compounds, designated (±)-penithrones A and B, along with a chlorinated variant (±)-penithrone C, were identified alongside their chemical precursors through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational structure prediction. The first two compounds demonstrated cell-damaging effects against three human cancer cell lines—HeLa, HCT116, and MCF-7—with inhibitory concentrations of 5.09 to 9.47 micromoles per litre. Computational analysis identified a protein called Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10 as a likely mechanism through which the most active compound exerts its cancer-killing effects.  This paper documents a material entanglement characteristic of contemporary drug discovery: a fungal strain sourced from a mangrove ecosystem—itself a landscape shaped by colonial land use and contemporary climate stress—yields compounds with direct application in cancer treatment. The chlorinated bianthrone and its non-chlorinated analogues represent both ecological products and pharmaceutical commodities, their cell-damaging capacity simultaneously a sign of the fungus's metabolic adaptation to its specific habitat and a potential vector for accumulation within pharmaceutical development pipelines. The mangrove-derived origin is noted but not elaborated; the fungus appears here primarily as a container for extractable value rather than as an organism embedded in particular histories of extraction, labour, and environmental transformation.",

    "source": "tandf: Mycology: Table of Contents",
    "excerpt": "Endogenous AICAR (acadesine) demonstrates significant therapeutic potential as a phase III clinical agent for the treatment of adverse cardiovascular reactions to coronary artery bypass grafting and as a phase I/II clinical agent for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains poorly defined. Our previous study demonstrated that AICAR was significantly enriched in the Fusarium solani mutant veAOE14, which overexpressed the global regulator VeA. We found that phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, viz., PRPS2 (PrsA) is regulated by VeA and involved in AICAR synthesis. Deletion of PRPS2 resulted in a significant 17% (μg/mg) reduction in AICAR production in the strain (p < 0.05), whereas its overexpression led to a statistically significant 1.2-fold increase in AICAR content (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we characterised the transcription factor MtfA, which inhibits the expression of PRPS2 gene and is negatively regulated by VeA. Further validation by yeast one-hybrid assay showed that MtfA directly regulated the PRPS2 gene, while AICAR was significantly increased in the mtfA deletion mutant. The above results indicate that the global regulator VeA negatively regulates the transcription factor MtfA, which in turn targets negatively regulating transcriptional levels of PRPS2 to mediate AICAR biosynthesis in F. solani.",

    "summary": "Fusarium solani produces acadesine (adenosine analogue AICAR), a compound in clinical trials for cardiovascular complications and leukaemia treatment. This paper identifies a regulatory pathway controlling acadesine biosynthesis: the global regulator VeA activates phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, an enzyme essential for the compound's production. Deletion of PRPS2 reduced acadesine levels by 17 percent, while overexpression increased production 1.2-fold. The paper further characterises MtfA, a transcription factor that suppresses PRPS2 expression and is itself inhibited by VeA; yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed direct binding between MtfA and the PRPS2 gene, and deletion of mtfA resulted in significantly elevated acadesine accumulation.  The regulatory architecture documented here reveals how a fungal metabolite with pharmaceutical value emerges not from inherent biosynthetic capacity alone, but from the tuning of transcriptional control. VeA's suppression of MtfA, which then releases inhibition of PRPS2, creates a metabolic state that favours acadesine accumulation — a finding that exposes the contingency of microbial chemistry on regulatory networks shaped by environmental and developmental signals. The same fungal strain that produces a clinical-stage therapeutic compound is simultaneously subject to genetic manipulation that intensifies or dampens that production, illustrating how the value of a fungal metabolite depends entirely on the engineered or selected state of its regulatory machinery.",
