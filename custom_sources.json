"excerpt": "I'm a social anthropologist, not a biologist or mycologist. But like everyone else on planet earth, I live with those environmentally ubiquitous, filamentous fungi that are commonly referred to in English as mold. Over the past five years, as I have been researching how people live with, adapt to, and build solutions to weather patterns that are attributable to rising greenhouse-gas emissions, I have come to understand that mold is everywhere. Across North America and Europe, mold is having a cultural moment, appearing in everything from time-lapse photography and haute cuisine to hit musicals and satirical television. Yet, mold has emerged as a visceral, cross-cultural signifier of planetary climate change. This chapter explores the 'metabolic rift' of industrial capitalism and the dual register of Aspergillus molds -- at once culturally constructed as harmful 'feral' threats requiring control and scientifically hailed as beneficial components of 'microbial metal factories' for the biotech economy.",
