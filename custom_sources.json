    [cite_start]"excerpt": "I'm a social anthropologist, not a biologist or mycologist. But like everyone else on planet earth, I live with those environmentally ubiquitous, filamentous fungi that are commonly referred to in English as mold[cite: 4, 5]. [cite_start]Over the past five years, as I have been researching how people live with, adapt to, and build solutions to weather patterns that are attributable to rising greenhouse-gas emissions, I have come to understand that mold is everywhere[cite: 10]. [cite_start]Across North America and Europe, mold is having a cultural moment, appearing in everything from time-lapse photography and haute cuisine to hit musicals and satirical television[cite: 12, 13, 14, 16, 17]. [cite_start]Yet, mold has emerged as a visceral, cross-cultural signifier of planetary climate change[cite: 20]. [cite_start]This chapter explores the 'metabolic rift' of industrial capitalism and the duel register of Aspergillus molds—at once culturally constructed as harmful 'feral' threats requiring control and scientifically hailed as beneficial components of 'microbial metal factories' for the biotech economy[cite: 51, 56, 149, 153, 156].",
